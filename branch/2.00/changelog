  http://tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/log/branch/2.00?rev=1161&stop_rev=1070

  * Adjustments to the default settings, to match the new deployment environment
    at AMS

  * Template updates for agendas: 
      - Use python, not template-language, to decide if the month is
	different.  
      - Don't use "odate" and add a space where   appropriate.  
      - Use a datetime and time zone instead of hardcoding (ET).
	(let the model combine the date and the time)

  * Per suggestion from John Klensin, add a link directly to the text of the
    I-D, but only give the explicit link to the draft if it's active.

  * Expanded description of a document on the agenda.

  * Added authorization infrastructure.  No impact on current functionality,
    but needed for future features.

  * Added a feed for documents on the IESG telechat.  Improved the admin
    interface for iesg_login and irtf rg's and chairs.

  * /meeting/ now redirects to meeting/<current>/materials.html

  * Licencing information added.  IETF Trust copyright added as needed.
