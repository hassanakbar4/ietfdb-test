ietfdb (2.37)

  * With this release, the datatracker is changed to run under Django 1.1
    rather than under 0.96, and in this sense it is a major release.  There
    is however very few changes that can be seen by the users, which is the
    reason why there is no major bump in the release number.

  Major changes, from Pasi and the code sprint participants:

  * Imported django/ directory from Django-1.1.1.tar.gz, placed in parallel
    with the top-level ietf/ directory in the tree.  This lets us run with
    a version of Django which could possibly be different than the system
    installed version.

  * Automated conversion of the code base to django-1.1 conventions, e.g.
    to use max_length instead of maxlength in model declarations.

  * Lots of escape and safe filters added to the templates, to handle the
    transition from 0.96 to 1.1.  This work was contributed by a number of
    people durint the IETF 76 code sprint:
	Pasi Eronen (also leading up to the IETF 76 code sprint)
	Tony Hansen
	Ben Campbell
	Tero Kivinen
	Adam Roach
	Arifumi Matsumoto

  * Code cleanup, including removal of unused and seldomly used code (in
    particular the code for mailing list change requests)

  * A lot more test cases added, in preparation for the transition to 1.1;
    also refinement of the testing framework.

  From Lars Eggert:

  * Support the use of UTF-8 in emails

  * Fixed the IPR submission tool to work under Django 1.1

    refactor and simplify the agenda code and templates.  Requires some database
    changes, too.

  * Made the liaison statement list inherit from base.html, to have the same style

  * Changed to table layout for the base page.  Not puristic, but the non-table

    below the lefthand menu even when there was space higher up), and I could see
    no easy way to fix it.

  * Added the text from the original IPR declaration to the detail page for
    declarations submitted by mail.  Made the link to the email text page more

    style sheet, and using a more consistent style, and introducing a
    lefthand menubar.

    which no longer was correct.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Nov 2008 17:20:49 +0100

    I-D, but only give the explicit link to the draft if it's active.

    but needed for future features.
