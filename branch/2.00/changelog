    exists.

ietfdb (2.23)

  * Fixed a wrong link in the html agenda (from Henrik)

  * Removed the explicit database server ip address in settings.py
    (from Henrik)

  * Integrated updated authorization system.  This requires applying
    database fixups as follows:

	python manage.py dbshell < ../test/sql_fixup.sql

    The existing htpasswd file can be imported into this new system
    as follows:

	export PYTHONPATH=/a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.23
	export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=ietf.settings
	/a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.23/ietf/bin/import-users /a/www/htpasswd

    Please capture the output of the import-users script, as it will
    help us resolve any troubles that users have.

    refactor and simplify the agenda code and templates.  Requires some database
    changes, too.

  * Made the liaison statement list inherit from base.html, to have the same style

  * Changed to table layout for the base page.  Not puristic, but the non-table

    below the lefthand menu even when there was space higher up), and I could see
    no easy way to fix it.

  * Added the text from the original IPR declaration to the detail page for
    declarations submitted by mail.  Made the link to the email text page more
    prominent. Fixed some html issues.

    fixes to the html.

  * Added more people to the autogenerated release mail.

    version of drafts)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  12 Feb 2009 13:22:08 +0100

  * Added to the mkrelease script the generation of a mail about the
    release to various interested parties.

    from Pasi Eronen <pasi.eronen@nokia.com>

    hardcoded IP address when it should be empty.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Nov 2008 17:20:49 +0100

ietfdb (2.11)

    menu-bar.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Nov 2008 17:20:49 +0100

ietfdb (2.10)

  * Changed look-and-feel of the datatracker, by introducing a different
    style sheet, and using a more consistent style, and introducing a
    lefthand menubar.

    information.  Tweaked the format of returned docstate information
    to not have spaces around the :: separator between state and substate.

    which no longer was correct.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Nov 2008 17:20:49 +0100

  * Adjustments to the default settings, to match the new deployment environment
    at AMS

  * Template updates for agendas: 
      - Use python, not template-language, to decide if the month is
	different.  
      - Don't use "odate" and add a space where   appropriate.  
      - Use a datetime and time zone instead of hardcoding (ET).
	(let the model combine the date and the time)

  * Per suggestion from John Klensin, add a link directly to the text of the
    I-D, but only give the explicit link to the draft if it's active.

  * Expanded description of a document on the agenda.

  * Added authorization infrastructure.  No impact on current functionality,
    but needed for future features.

  * Added a feed for documents on the IESG telechat.  Improved the admin
    interface for iesg_login and irtf rg's and chairs.

  * /meeting/ now redirects to meeting/<current>/materials.html

  * Licencing information added.  IETF Trust copyright added as needed.
