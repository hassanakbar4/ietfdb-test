  <h1>Personal Information in the Datatracker</h1>
   <p>

     <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3935">RFC 3935, "A Mission Statement for the IETF"</a> lays out
     the goal and the mission of the IETF as follows:
   </p>

     <samp class="preformatted small">   The goal of the IETF is to make the Internet work better.

   The mission of the IETF is to produce high quality, relevant
   technical and engineering documents that influence the way people
   design, use, and manage the Internet in such a way as to make the
   Internet work better.  These documents include protocol standards,
   best current practices, and informational documents of various kinds.
     </samp>

   <p>

     In order to fulfil its mission, the IETF provides ways to distribute
     drafts, discuss them, ballot them, and otherwise process them to the
     point where they are considered ready for publication.

   </p>
   <p>

     This makes the information in the draft documents, as well as
     contributions related to the draft documents and their processing, as
     laid out in the "<a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/">Note
     Well</a>" statement, of legitimate interest to the IETF when it pursues
     its mission; not only in general terms, but specifically under Article
     6(1)&nbsp;f) of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679#d1e1888-1-1">
     EU's General Data Protection Regulation </a>.

   </p>
   <p>

     The datatracker treats all personal information derived from draft documents and
     documents published as RFC accordingly, as well as personal information derived from
     processing draft documents through the IETF process.  This includes author names,
     email addresses and other address information provided in draft documents or as
     contact information for IETF roles such as Working Group chairs, secretaries,
     Area Directors and other roles.

   </p>
   <p>

     There is however personal information held in the datatracker which
     is not considered covered by Legitimate Interest.  This information
     requires Consent for its storage and processing, and the person it
     relates to may at any time request its removal.  This includes:

   </p>

   <ul>
     <li>Personal photo</li>
     <li>Personal biography</li>
     <li>Personal email addresses not derived from IETF contributions</li>
     <li>Personal account login information</li>
   </ul>

   <p>

     Most of this information can be edited on their <a
     href="/accounts/profile/">Account Info</a> page by anybody with an
     account.  If the datatracker holds such information about a person, and
     they don't have an account, a request to the <a
     href="mailto:ietf-action@ietf.org">IETF secretariat</a> to change or
     remove the information will be honoured.

   </p>
