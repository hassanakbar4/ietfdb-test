	 <h2>Pre-Release</h2>

	    <ul class="simple">
	       <!-- Done -->
	       <li><strong>DONE</strong>  Initial merge with trunk (on separate branch)</li>
	       <li><strong>DONE</strong>  Re-style to make people recognise that they are at the datatracker</li>
	       <li><strong>DONE</strong>  Use a designed colour palette rather than arbitrary element colours</li>
	       <li><strong>DONE</strong>  The extra FontAwesome add-in seems to add glyphs already bundled in
		  glyphicons, which adds page load time and update complexity; see if we
		  can reduce to only the bundled glyphs.  <em>Conclusion: not feasible</em></li>
	       <li><strong>DONE</strong>  Have a look at using slightly more readable fonts than the current
		  one, and change font families if it looks reasonable</li>
	       <li><strong>DONE</strong>  Align the use of info and warning background colours with the info and
		  warning button colours</li>
	       <li><strong>DONE</strong>  Add an 'About' page which gives credit to those working on the facelift.</li>
	       <hr/>
	       <!-- Remaining -->
	       <li>Rename the base template back to 'base.html' from 'ietf.html' now that
		  all templates using the old base have been fixed</li>
	       <li>Fix the missing IPR values on search and group pages.</li>
	       <li>Fix style consistency, for instance in WG metadata table vs. document
		  metadata table, WG doc list vs. release list, and more</li>
	       <li>The header colours on the meeting requests page have inverted colour
		  logic compared to other list pages (info background for warnings, warning
		  background for sub-headers).  Empty warning panes are shown.  Fix.</li>
	       <li>The agenda page uses warning colours for day headers.  Fix.</li>
	       <li>On tablets, the ballot grids has a 'click to show more' which has a
		  z-value larger than the pop-up.  This only matters because it doesn't go
		  away on click on tablets.  Fix.</li>
	       <li>Replace buttons which are links with something which is recognisable
		  as links, preferably in submenu form. (Could be done post-release).</li>
	       <li>Final merge to trunk</li>
	    </ul>

      </div>
      <div class="section" id="post-release">
	 <h2>Post-Release</h2>

	    <ul class="simple">
	       <li>Maybe change alert, warning, etc. fonts to sans?</li>
	       <li>Fix input fields to have appropriate type setting, in order to provide
		  the appropriate keyboard on mobile devices (email address keyboard,
		  url keyboard, and possibly others).  Set autocorrect and autocaptitalise
		  attributes correctly, also to make things easier on mobile devices.</li>
	       <li>The materials page has very different column width for the different
		  areas.  Consider normalising.  Check IPR list page for possible approach.</li>
	       <li>The ballot grids don't use the position colours used in the pop-up (the
		  colours in the pop-up is based on the palette colours).  Mabye align grid
		  position colours with pop-up position colours?</li>
	       <li>Remove general uglyness (like the overly large section descriptions on
		  <a class="reference external" href="http://zin.tools.ietf.org:31415/sync/discrepancies/">http://zin.tools.ietf.org:31415/sync/discrepancies/</a>)</li>
	       <li>Change the room map links on the agenda to use pop-overs instead of
		  pointing off to the room maps on tools.ietf.org</li>
	    </ul>
