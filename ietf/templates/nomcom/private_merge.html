  <h2>Merging nominee email addresses</h2>
  <p>If a nominee has been nominated with multiple email addresses, the nominee will appear multiple times in the nomination list, as the email address is used as the unique identifier for each nominee. In order to permit comments and nominations to be submitted under multiple email addresses, there is a list of secondary email addresses which needs to be kept up-to-date. When nominations of one particular nominee have already been made under different email addresses, the nomination comments from the secondary address also needs to be merged with those under the primary address. It doesn't matter particularly which email address is used as primary, as far as the nominee information maintenance goes, but it's probably handier for the nomcom if the primary address is the one which the nominee prefers at the time.</p>
