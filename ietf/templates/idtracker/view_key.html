Key to how the Secretariat has historically recorded Evaluations:
   
- A single X in one of the four columns has the obvious meaning.

- Two X's (i.e, XX) in a column indicate a change from a previous
  selection. I.e., An XX in "yes" and an X in "Discuss" indicates a
  change from discuss to yes.

- an "R" in the Abstain column means "Recuse"

- a "D" in the Discuss column indicates "Defer"
