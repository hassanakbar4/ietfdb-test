The Internet Open Trading Protocol provides an interoperable framework 
for Internet commerce.  It is payment system independent and will be 
able to encapsulate payment systems such as SET, Mondex, CyberCash, 
DigiCash, GeldKarte, etc.  IOTP is able to handle cases where such 
merchant roles as the shopping site, the payment handler,the deliverer 
of goods or services, and the provider of customer support are performed 
by different parties or by one party.

The Internet Open Trading Protocol working group will (1) determine
requirements for IOTP transport and for IOTP 2.0, (2) document
interoperability experience with IOTP v1.0 (which will have been
published as Informational), and (3) develop the specification for IOTP
transport and IOTP version 2.0.

Selection of items for inclusion in v2.0 is expected to be from the
following and others suggested by the Working Group:

- Dynamic Definition of Trading Sequences
- Multiple Protocol Options
- Offer Request Block
- Public Key Signatures (v1.0 uses secret key signatures)
- Signatures on the Delivery Response
- Improved Problem Resolution (extend to cover presentation of
  signed receipt to customer support party, etc.)
- Selection of Additional Options
- Shorter Element and Attribute Names
- Transaction Status Inquiry (if not included in v1.0)
- OTP Architecture (informational development of standard interfaces
  to software components).

The following are out of scope for v2.0:

- server to server communications protocols (except as protocol
  elements needed for client to server communications may also be
  useful for server to server communications)
- legal or regulatory issues surrounding the implementation of the
  protocol or information systems using it.
