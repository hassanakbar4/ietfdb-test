Proposed Charter 2/12/93 - md

To see if there is interest in writing a Frame Relay Network MIB.  The Frame
Relay forum has expressed a need for a Fram Relay Network MIB to support 
end-customer network management of a Frame Relay Network.  This MIB will be
used to monitor the frame relay portions of a Frame Relay Network, and will 
rely on other MIBs (i.e., DS1 MIB - RFC1406) to monitor the physical layer.
This MIB will initially be limited in scope to support only a few applications,
but will be devised to be extendable.  Work has already begun in the Frame
Relay Forum to support this activity, but it is hoped that the IETF will
standardize the MIB as a proposed standard RFC.
