Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling and 
routing is applicable to Layer 2 technologies. However, up to now, 
very little attention has been given to the control of Ethernet 
switches using GMPLS protocols in support of point-to-point paths.

The purpose of this BoF is to determine interest in applying GMPLS to
Ethernet LSR. As it is a non-objective of the IETF to initiate any
Ethernet data plane work, the purpose of this BoF is also to highlight
and discuss foreseen interactions with other SDOs, in particular, the
IEEE 802.1, with respect to the data plane operations.

This BOF will also discuss the consequent GMPLS control plane
requirements and what extensions to existing GMPLS protocols may be
required and whether there is cause and support for this work within 
the IETF.
