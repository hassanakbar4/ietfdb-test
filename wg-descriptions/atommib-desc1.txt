     The AToM MIB Working Group is chartered to define sets of managed
     objects which will be useful in the management of ATM and SONET
     equipment (interfaces, networks, and/or services that conform
     to the relevant ATM and SONET specifications).  The initial sets
     defined will be:

       - An interface-specific MIB for ATM interfaces, which is aligned with
         the managed objects for interface layering being defined by the
         Interfaces MIB Working Group.  The working group should consider 
         the ATM Forum's ILMI MIB for its suitability in this respect, plus 
         any extensions necessary to instrument the layers between the ATM
         layer and the IP layer (e.g., AAL5).  The latter should
         take into account the work of the IP over ATM
         Working Group (e.g., the ``Multi-Protocol over AAL5''
         specification).

       - Managed objects for the monitoring and control of ATM PVCs and
         SVCs, both in ATM end-points and in ATM switches or networks.
         (Objects for ATM SVCs will be considered after completion of the
	 work on ATM PVCs.) 

       - Managed objects that instrument devices with SONET interfaces
         that conform with the relevant SONET specifications.  This work
         should closely align to other trunk MIBs (DS1/E1 MIB, DS3/E3 MIB).
         The working group should consider the existing Internet-Draft SONET
         MIB for its suitability in this respect.
