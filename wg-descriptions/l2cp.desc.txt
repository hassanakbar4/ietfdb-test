There is significant interest in the use of an IP based Layer 2 device
Control Protocol to manage and configure service provider access 
network equipment. This BOF will present a summary of the problem 
areas and requirements as identified by discussions in the DSL Forum. 
A set of protocol solution proposals based on modifications and 
extensions to the GSMPv3 protocol and items for future work will also 
be presented. Based on the discussion, we will determine whether we 
should form an IETF WG covering this topic.
