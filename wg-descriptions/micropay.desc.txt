The Internet is quickly becoming the prefered method of delivery for 
information and on-line services. The growth of this industry is 
resticted by the limited availability of secure online payment
mechanisms, especially for small amounts. Micropayments are designed to 
allow charging of small amounts, where the minimal fees of credit-card 
payments are unacceptable. There have been, and still are, many attempts 
at providing a micropayments solution, however so far none of them was 
successful, and in particular none of the deployed systems seems to be 
able to reach critical mass of buyers and sellers. Furthermore, even if 
one or more of these systems gain popularity, the lack of 
standardization may slow down their availability. In this BOF we'll 
review some recent micropayment markup standardization spec from
the W3C, and discuss whether the IETF should attempt to contribute 
standards in this area  - i.e. should we create a micropayments WG (and 
if so what would its charter and goals be).
