There is a wide interest of e-mail users to know if and when a message
has been shown to a (human) recipient. This functionality is available
for a number of PC e-mail systems and within X.400. The receipt working
group will specify the necessary extensions to support this
functionality within the Internet Mail environment and optionally also
specify the necessary mappings for MIXER gateways.

The result of this work will be a Proposed Standard specifying:

o The mechanism used for requesting that the recipient issue a 
read-receipt.

o The format used for transferring read-receipts.

o The advice on the privacy and security issues involved in 
read-receipts.
