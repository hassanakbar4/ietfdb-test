     The Character MIB Working Group is chartered to prepare a
     recommendation to the IESG evaluating RFCs 1316-1318 (the Character
     MIBs) with respect to the standards track.

     The recommendation will document implementation, interoperability,
     and deployment experience.  If these experiences suggest that
     changes should be made to the documents, new drafts may be
     prepared.  The recommendation will report one of four outcomes for
     each RFC:

	- That the RFC should be advanced from Proposed to Draft Standard status,
	  without changes (if no problems are found);

	- That a draft prepared by the working group should replace the
	  RFC, and be designated a Draft Standard (if only minor
	  changes are made);

	- That a draft prepared by the working group should replace the
	  RFC, and be designated a Proposed Standard (if major
	  changes or feature enhancements are made); or,

	- That the RFC should be designated as Historic (if this
	  technology is problematic).
