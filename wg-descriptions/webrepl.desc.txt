Ideas on how to replicate contents of webservers (including caches) 
have been floating around in the web community. Replication includes
several steps -- from prefetching information (pushing or polling), 
to announcement of the availability of new content (again pushing or
polling). This gets even more complicated when starting to use
hierarichal caches.

It is also the case that in this area, the community don't want
proprietary protocols, as one cache should be able to communicate 
with another one -- even though it is developed by a different vendor.

This BOF is ment to check the interest in the community on this matter,
and see of there is a possibility to try to focus some work on some few
items, that have to be standardized.
