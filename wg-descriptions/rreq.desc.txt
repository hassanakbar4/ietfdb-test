The Router Requirements Working Group has the goal of publishing the
existing draft as an Historic RFC, then updating it to include 
references to more recent work, such as OSPF, BGP, multicast, etc.
Unlike other groups, this is recognized as an on-going effort that
should result in a series of drafts. It is expected that a revised
requirements draft will be published on a regular basis.
 
The working group will also instigate, review, or (if appropriate)
produce additional RFCs on related topics.  To date, group members have
produced draft documents discussing the operation of routers which are 
in
multiple routing domains (3 papers), TOS, and a routing table MIB.
 
The purposes of this project include:
 
- Defining what an IP router does in sufficient detail that
  routers from different vendors are truly interoperable.
 
- Providing guidance to vendors, implementors, and purchasers of
  IP routers.
 
The working group has decided that, unlike RFC 1009, the Router 
Requirements
document should not discuss link layer protocols or address resolution.
Instead, those topics should be covered in a separate Link Layer 
Requirements
document, applicable to hosts as well as routers.  Whether this group 
will
create the Link Layer Requirements document is still to be determined.
