The IAB is holding an invitational workshop on the status of 
the Internet network layer, and future scenarios for it, in the 
week before the IETF meeting. Issues will include prospects
for both IPv4 and IPv6, and related end-to-end issues.
The BOF will act as a preliminary report to the IETF on the 
discussions, conclusions and recommendations of the workshop.
