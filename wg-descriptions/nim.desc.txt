As the Internet has grown and flourished, new technologies have been
developed and deployed at a feverish pace. In the traditional IETF
operations and management model, the working group developing the
technology has also defined the data elements (MIB definitions) 
necessary to monitor and manage the technology. While this has been 
very successful, it has also led to a divergence of definitions and 
structures. In many cases similar management elements have been 
completely reinvented in different working groups because of a lack 
of awareness. In other cases duplication has occurred because of a 
subtle variation in the definition of the element or because the 
relationship between the data element and other elements is new or 
different.

It is recognized that the major benefit of an information model is
its ability to reuse previously defined constructs across various
applications.  In order to see the benefits of an information model, 
each addition to the model needs to be scrutinized for the reuse of 
constructs that have already been defined in the model. As such, the 
primary objective of this BOF is to determine the feasibility of 
defining an information modeling language for the IETF that organizes 
information to maximize reuse and provides consistency in the 
information representation across various protocols and services.
