This BOF will focus on proposals for quality improvement within the 
IETF process, and determine if there is enough substance to work on a 
framework within which these proposals are evaluated. The outcome of 
the BOF will be to determine how best to proceed with these issues in 
the IETF.

There are concerns about the quality and timeliness of IETF output. 
These problems are enumerated in the IETF Problem Statement, currently 
under development in the Problem Statement Working Group. The current 
IETF Problem Resolution Process document suggests that a Working Group 
be formed to improve the quality processes, including review processes, 
used by IETF Working Groups.

The goals of this BOF will be to determine a basic approach that the 
IETF could take to WG process improvement, examine some of the 
documented proposal for process improvement, and determine if there is 
enough interest and content to warrant the creation of a WG to improve 
the quality processes used by Working Groups.

One goal is to write one or more documents on aspects of a WG quality 
plan.  For example, a document on tracking tools - what's available, 
and more importantly, how to use them to improve quality.  Another 
document on reviews - how they might be conducted, the rules for 
reviewing, choosing reviewers, etc.  The benefit of this is that it 
while it requires Working Groups to think about the issue, it doesn't 
require that all working groups come up with the same plan.
