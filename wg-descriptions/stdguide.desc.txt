This working group will provide a forum for implementers, testers, and
users of current Internet standard protocols to provide feedback on the
standards themselves; i.e., on what aspects of the documents defining
the standards have assisted or hindered the implementation, test, and
use of those protocols.

The purpose of the group is to collect this information, much of which
survives today as word-of-mouth knowledge in the Internet community,
and present it as a BCP document. This document will cover definitions,
guidelines, and a list of heuristic rules for avoiding common mistakes
in writing Internet protocol standards documents.

Note: This working group is jointly chartered by the Operational
Requirements Area and the User Services Area.
