The RMON MIB Working Group is chartered to prepare a recommendation to
the IESG evaluating RFC 1271 (the RMON MIB) with respect to the
standards track.

The recommendation will document implementation, interoperability,
and deployment experience.  If this experience suggests that changes
should be made to the document, a new draft may be prepared.  The
recommendation will report one of four outcomes:

  - that RFC 1271 should be advanced from Proposed to Draft Standard status,
    without changes (if no problems are found);

  - that a draft prepared by the working group, should replace RFC
    1271, and be designated a Draft Standard (if only minor
    changes are made);

  - that a draft prepared by the working group, should replace RFC
    1271, and be designated a Proposed Standard (if major
    changes or feature enhancements are made); or,

  - that RFC 1271 should be designated as Historic (if this
    technology is problematic).
