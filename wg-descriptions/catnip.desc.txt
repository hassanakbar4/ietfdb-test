CATNIP is a new version of the IP protocol, converged with a
compressed form of CLNP, and a form of Novell IPX that permits
general interoperation.  The objective is to provide common ground
between the Internet, OSI, and the Novell protocols, as well as to
advance the Internet technology to the scale and performance of the
next generation of internetwork technology. CATNIP has been assigned
the IP version number 7. The CATNIP proposal has evolved from the
TP/IX protocol (RFC 1475) and the TUBA proposal (RFC 1347). 

The working group is chartered to review the CATNIP protocol,
evaluate issues arising during product development and deployment
planning, and to document problems and explanations for any parts of
the coexistance with IPv4 not covered directly in the CATNIP-IPv4
interoperation design. 

CATNIP includes definitions covering the same ground as the TUBA
project, and within the charter of the TUBA Working Group. This will
be handled by coordination with the TUBA Working Group. The intent is
to arrive at complete alignment between the TUBA work and the CLNP
component in CATNIP.

The group will also continue to be the forum for development of the RAP
protocol and the TCP extensions while in experimental status; this
work will need to be moved to the Transport and Routing Area(s) if it
is to be advanced; this work is outside the charter of the IPng Area.
