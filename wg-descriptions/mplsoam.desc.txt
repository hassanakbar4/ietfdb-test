The purpose of the MPLS OAM BOF is to determine what type of operations 
and maintenance tools are required for MPLS networks. The BOF will 
address if traceroute and ping are sufficient operations and 
maintenance tools for MPLS network operators. The BOF will consider the 
need for other types of OAM tools for MPLS networks.
