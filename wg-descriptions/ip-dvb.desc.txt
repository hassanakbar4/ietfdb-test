The MPEG-2 Transport Stream provides a transmission network that has
become widely use to support digital TV broadcast, including: DVB, DAB,
ATSC, ISDB-T. These and related standards define a set of commercially
available components that are increasingly being used  to provide a
general-purpose packet transmission network.  MPEG-2 Transport networks
are being used to build IP networks to supplement broadcast TV/audio
services and also to provide one-way and two-way IP-only subnetworks. 


The BOF will explore how the IETF might work to define documents that
describe the protocols required to build a complete IPv4/IPv6
unicast/multicast service, and the mappings that are needed to perform
address resolution, etc. A set of Internet Drafts will be reviewed
describing requirements, and some proposed protocols.
