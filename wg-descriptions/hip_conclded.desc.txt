IP has suffered for the lack of security.  Efforts like IPsec and 
DNSSEC 
have added various levels of security to IP, but have not addressed 
some 
of the fundamental security deficiencies in IP.  By adding a 
cryptographic Host Identity and a payload for its exchange between two 
hosts, we can greatly enhance the security of IP while addressing a 
fundamental flaw in IP.  This flaw being the lack of a true identity 
for 
a host that is independent of how IP packets are routed to a host.

By adding a Host Identity namespace to the IP protocol, the role of the 
IP address changes to simply a packet forwarding namespace, since all 
of 
the higher protocols are bound to the Host Identity.  This provides for 
cleaner host mobility and addressing realm transition (i.e. NAT) 
methodology.  However, adding a Host Identity provides for a new class 
of Denial Of Service attacks, and thus the Host Identity Payload (HIP) 
and its exchange protocol are carefully crafted to not only avoid 
introducing DOS attacks, but also to lessen the opportunity for the 
existing transport level DOS attacks.
