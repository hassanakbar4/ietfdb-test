Tag switching BOF

Numerous proposals have been made for mechanisms to efficiently
support IP routing (or other network layer protocols) using layer 2
forwarding technologies based on label swapping. If products using
such techniques are to interoperate, then some aspects of the
mechanism need to be standardized. These include: 

 - the protocol which is used to bind forwarding labels to IP (or
other network layer) forwarding information;

 - the encapsulations for carrying IP packets over various layer 2
links.

The goal of this BOF is to establish whether there is interest in the
IETF community in such a standardisation effort. If there is, the goal
would be to produce a working group charter for standardisation of the
binding protocol and encapsulations.
