The RADIUS protocol resulted from the first NAS Requirements
effort, and as such, as enjoyed great success in helping
build large switched-access collector networks.  The RADIUS
working group is in the final stages of finishing the documentation
of the existing RADIUS protocol as influenced by current
deployment experience.

This experience, however, has made it clear that the requirements
for today's large collector networks are more complex and
subtle than those identified in the first NASREQ effort,
and as such, there are capability requirements which cannot
readily be addressed by RADIUS without significant, deep
conceptual changes.

Rather than simply hack away at RADIUS, as some suggest,
this BOF will assess the interest in and likelyhood of
success of a new, clean-sheet NAS Requirements effort which
will attempt to produce a larger, more comprehensive framework
capturing these new, richer requirements.

The result of this effort would be a new version of NAS
Requirements document. That document would then form the
basis of a charter for a protocol development effort to address
those new requirements.

The NASREQng effort is expected to be hosted in the Operational
Requirements Area because that is very much what is to
be captured: requirements for operational capabilities.
Any resulting protocol development, however, would be hosted
in a more appropriate area to be decided when that becomes
a real issue.
