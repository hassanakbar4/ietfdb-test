     The Modem Management Working Group is chartered to define a MIB
     module for dial-up modems and similar dial-up devices.  This MIB
     module will provide a set of objects that are the minimum necessary
     to provide the ability to monitor and control those devices, and
     will be consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP
     standards.

     The working group will consider existing specifications including
     the RS-232--like, Character, PPP and other related MIB
     modules.  It will consider enterprise-specific MIB modules which
     support modem-like devices.  The working group will also consider
     the TSB Study Group 14's work on an OSI CMIS/CMIP object definition
     for V series DCEs entitled ``Managed Object Template for V-Series
     DCEs.''
