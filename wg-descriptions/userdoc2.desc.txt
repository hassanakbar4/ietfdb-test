The focus of the USERDOC2 Working Group is on identifying and locating
documentation about the Internet. A major activity is the revision of
an existing bibliography of on-line and hard copy documents/reference
materials/training tools addressing general networking information and
``How to use the Internet'' (RFC 1175, FYI 3). This effort will also be
used to help locate documentation produced by other organizations and
examine the means by which such documents are made available on the
Internet. The target audience is those individuals who provide services
to end users and end users themselves. The group is also developing a
new FYI RFC document designed as a very short bibliography targeted at
novice users.

The USERDOC2 Working Group will:

(1) Identify and categorize useful documents, reference materials,
training tools, and other publications about the Internet, particularly
those available on-line.

(2) Publish on-line and hard copies of the bibliographies produced and
other reference material on documentation as needs are identified.

(3) Develop and implement procedures to maintain and update the
bibliography and investigate methods to provide the information in an
on-line format.

(4) As a part of the update process, identify new materials for
inclusion in the active bibliography and identify additional needs
which are required for locating documentation and other publications.

(5) Review procedures for periodic review of the bibliography by the
User Services Working Group.

(6) Examine methods for delivering documentation and work with
providers to improve the availability of basic Internet documentation.
