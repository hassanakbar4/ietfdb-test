The POP working group is chartered to survey existing POP
implementations and determine how well implementations match the
specification in RFC 1225.  Based on this survey, determine what
clarifications need to be made to the specification and also what
additional features or simplifications are warranted.

The scope of the working group focuses only on POP 3.  Work on other
mailbox access protocols are not within the charter of this working
group.
