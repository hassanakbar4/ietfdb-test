Many Internet protocols and applications which use the Internet employ
public key technology for security purposes and require a public key
infrastructure to manage public keys.

The task of the working group will be to develop Internet standards
for an IETF sponsored public key certificate format, associated
signature and other formats, and key acquisition protocols.  The key
certificate format and associated protocols are to be simple to
understand, implement, and use. For purposes of the working group, the
resulting formats and protocols are to be known as the Simple Public
Key Infrastructure, or SPKI.

The SPKI is intended to provide mechanisms to support security in a
wide range of internet applications, including IPSEC protocols,
encrypted electronic mail and WWW documents, payment protocols, and
any other application which will require the use of public key
certificates and the ability to access them. It is intended that the
Simple Public Key Infrastructure will support a range of trust models.
