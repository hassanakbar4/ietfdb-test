This Working Group is chartered to consider technical contributions to
the SNMP evolution process and to produce a single recommendation as
to which contributions (or combinations or modifications thereof)
should define the next generation SNMP network management framework.

The announced deadline for technical contributions to the SNMP
evolution process is September 10, 1992. Any individual interested in
contributing to this process should prepare and submit his/her
contribution according to the requirements for detail, completeness,
copyright, and format set forth in the original announcement. This
Working Group is under no obligation to consider contributions that do
not meet these basic requirements or contributions that are not
submitted by the contribution deadline.

This Working Group has the option of (a) rejecting any or all
contributions as the basis for positive evolution, (b) accepting any
or all contributions as candidates for standardization, or (c)
modifying or combining any or all contributions to produce consensus
proposals for standardization.

The product of the Working Group will be a single recommendation to
the IESG identifying those submitted specifications (or modifications
thereof), if any, whose standardization as part of the SNMP framework
is agreed to be warranted and desirable.  The Working Group will not
be chartered to produce tutorial, explanatory, advisory, or
informational documents of any kind.

In its deliberations, the Working Group will take special cognizance
of architectural principles on which the historic success of SNMP has
rested:

(1) The SNMP framework minimizes the overall cost of a manageable
network by minimizing the cost and complexity of those management
system components that are most numerous.

(2) The SNMP framework fosters ubiquity of deployment by admitting the
widest possible range of implementation strategies.

(3) The SNMP framework fosters operational robustness by realizing
management system function as closely as possible to centers of
responsible authority.

(4) The SNMP framework fosters operational robustness by locating
control of resources consumed by the management activity (e.g.,
bandwidth, processing) as closely as possible to centers of
responsible authority.

Moreover, the deliberations of the Working Group will take special
cognizance of at least two aspects of evolutionary logistics:

(1) A single transition from existing SNMP technology to the next
stage of SNMP evolution is highly desirable; multi-stage or protracted
transitions are less desirable.

(2) Minimizing the number of distinct management technologies
concurrently deployed in the Internet is highly desirable.

Consistent with the community desire for timely, deliberate progress,
the Working Group may be disbanded at the time of the IETF plenary
meeting in the Spring of 1993 regardless of whether or not it has
produced the single recommendation required by its Charter.

This Working Group is not chartered to consider security aspects of
the SNMP framework, as these are addressed as a matter of course by an
existing IETF working group.
