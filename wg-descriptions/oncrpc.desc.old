The purpose of the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call
Working Group is to update the RFCs that
describe ONC RPC to reflect the current state of the deployed and
accepted technology, and submit them for Internet standardization.

ONC RPC is currently described in ``RPC: Remote Procedure Call
Protocol Specification Version 2'' (RFC 1057), and ``XDR: External
Data Representation Standard'' (RFC 1014).

The focus of the ONC-RPC Working Group is to document and standardize
the current ONC RPC protocols. It is not the intent of this working group
to develop extensions to these protocols. However, once these tasks are
completed, discussions of future enhancements are expected. These
discussions could lead to a follow on working group.

Background:

ONC RPC is a Remote Procedure Call technology that originated in Sun
Microsystems in the early 1980s. ONC RPC was modelled on Xerox's
Courier RPC protocols. It has been widely deployed on platforms from
most major workstation vendors. It has been implemented on MS-DOS,
Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Windows NT, Mac, VMS, MVS, and
practically all flavors of UNIX, among others. Sun Microsystems plans
to give the ownership of ONC RPC and change control over the ONC RPC
protocols to the IETF.
