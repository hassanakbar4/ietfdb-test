The purpose of the BOF is to discuss the recent formation of the 
Interent Assignment Hierarchy Coalition (IAHC), present its work 
to date and thoughts for making progress, and to solicit comments 
and respond to questions from the IETF community.

From the IAHC's charter:

The Domain Name System (DNS) is an essential component in the 
Internet's operational infrastructure.  Designed for locating 
machines on the Internet, it maps between their human-friendly 
names and their transport (IP) addresses.  Machine names are a 
series of textual fields, representing a registration and lookup 
hierarchy.  Each registry in the hiearchy is delegated authority 
from the registry above.  A number of "Top Level Domain" (TLD) 
registries already exist: one for each country, and a small number 
which are international (iTLD) such as .com, .org and .net.  For 
more than ten years the set of TLD registries was stable and 
sufficient.  The recent explosive commercialization of the Internet 
has produced a requirement for enhanced assignment procedures.  
A complicating factor is that the human-friendly quality of Domain 
Name strings has also made them commercially valuable.  The IAHC 
is an international multi- organization effort, for specifying and 
implementing policies and procedures relating to iTLD.
