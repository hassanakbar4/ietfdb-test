The goal of this working group is to develop and review revised
versions of RFC 821 and RFC 822, incorporating the revisions in RFC
974, RFC 1123, and RFC 1651.

In addition, the group will review other RFCs related to messaging, and
determine the applicability of each of these to the future direction of
the messaging in the Internet. The group may choose to incorporate,
deprecate, or write applicability statements for such documents, as
necessary to produce a clear statement of requirements for overall
interoperability of Internet electronic mail.

The documents produced by the working group are intended to be
submitted to the IESG for consideration as Internet Standards.

Items appropriate for inclusion in documents produced by the working
group include corrections, clarifications, and amplifications to
reflect existing practice or to address problems which have been
identified through experience with Internet mail protocols. New
functionality is expressly inappropriate.
