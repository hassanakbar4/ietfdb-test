The CIDR Deployment Working Group will be a forum for
coordinating the deployment, engineering, and operation of classless
routing protocols and procedures in the global Internet. This activity
will include, but not be limited to:

  - Deployment of CIDR addressing and routing in the global Internet.
     Will include coordination of deployment of new exterior routing
     protocols, such as BGP4, which support CIDR.

  - Develop mechanisms and procedures for sharing operational
    information to aim the operation.

  - Development of procedures, policies, and mechanisms to improve
    the utilization efficiency of the IPv4 address space.

  - Work on longer-term strategies for hierarchical, CIDR-based
    addressing and routing. Examples include class A subnetting and
    provider block sub-allocation along geographical/topological
    boundaries as is done for 193.0.0.0 and 194.0.0.0 in Europe.

Initially, this working group will be simply the reincarnation of the
BGP Deployment Working Group under a new name.
