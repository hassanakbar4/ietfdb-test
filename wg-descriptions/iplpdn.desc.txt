The IP over Large Public Data Networks Working Group will
specify the operation of the TCP/IP protocol suite over Public Data
Networks (PDNs) such as SMDS, ISDN, X.25 PDNs, and Frame Relay.  The
working group will develop and define algorithms for the resolution of
IP addresses and for the routing of IP datagrams over large,
potentially global, public data networks.

The IP over SMDS Working Group has defined the operation of the
Internet protocols when SMDS is used to support relatively small
virtual private networks, or Logical IP Subnets (LISs).  Issues
arising from public and global connectivity were delegated to the
IPLPDN Working Group. 

The IPLPDN Working Group will also continue the work of the Private Data Network
Routing Working Group (PDNROUT) on X.25 PDNs.  This work will be
extended to include call management and the use of the ISDN B channels
for the transport of IP datagrams.

Address resolution and routing over Frame Relay will also be
discussed.
