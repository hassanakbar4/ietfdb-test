RFC 1327 describes mappings to enable interworking between e-mail
systems using RFC 822 and e-mail systems using CCITT X.400(88). RFC 1327
is a Proposed Standard and up for review. A specially formed review
team has proposed to integrate RFC 1494, RFC 1495, outcome of the NOTARY
group (support for delivery notifications in SMTP) and align it with
X.400(92). The name of the specification is MIXER which stands for Mime
Internet X.400 Enhanced Relay.  The working group will review the MIXER
draft, refine it as needed and move the document to Proposed Standard.

The goal is to concentrate the work in a single document.
