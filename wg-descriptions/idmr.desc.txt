The Internet-Draft Multicast Remnants (idmr) working group is chartered
to finish certain parts of the work started in the Inter-Domain  
multicast Routing (idmr) working group. The group is expected to live 
only long enough to see the existing work items into the standards 
track, and will not take on new work items.

Some of the work previously done in IDMR has moved to the MAGMA working
group.

The specific work items are:

DVMRP, DVMRP MIB, IGMPv3, Multicast Router Discovery.
