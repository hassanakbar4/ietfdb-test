The goal of the Authenticated Firewall Traversal Working Group is to 
specify a protocol to address the issue of application-layer support for 
firewall traversal. The working group intends to specify a traversal 
protocol supporting both TCP and UDP applications with a general 
framework for authentication of the firewall traversal. To promote
interoperability, the group will also propose a base authentication 
technique for use within the general authentication framework.  

The output of the group will consist of a standards-track RFC(s) 
describing the traversal protocol, the base authentication methods and a 
reference implementation of the protocol, and base authentication 
methods. The working group will start with the SOCKS system described by 
David Koblas in his paper presented at the 1992 Usenix Security 
Symposium.
