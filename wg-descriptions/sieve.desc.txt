The SIEVE email filtering language is specified in RFC 5228, together
with a number of extensions.

The SIEVE working group is being re-chartered to:

(1) Finish work on existing in-progress Working Group documents:
    (a) Notify mailto (draft-ietf-sieve-notify-mailto)
    (c) Mime loops (draft-ietf-sieve-mime-loop)
    (d) Refuse/reject (draft-ietf-sieve-refuse-reject)

(2) Finalize and publish the following SIEVE extensions as proposed
standards:
    (a) iHave (draft-freed-sieve-ihave)
    (b) Notary (draft-freed-sieve-notary)
    (c) SIEVE in XML (draft-freed-sieve-in-xml)
    (d) Notify-sip (draft-melnikov-sieve-notify-sip-message)
    (e) ManageSIEVE (draft-martin-managesieve)
    (f) RegEx (draft-ietf-sieve-regex)
    (g) Meta-data (draft-melnikov-sieve-imapext-metadata)
    (h) Include/multi-script (draft-daboo-sieve-include)
    (i) Address data (draft-melnikov-sieve-external-lists)
    (j) Support for Sieve in IMAP (draft-ietf-lemonade-imap-sieve)

Additional drafts may be added to this list, but only via a charter
revision. There must also be demonstrable willingness in the SIEVE
development community to actually implement a given extension before it
can be added to this charter.

(3) Work on a specification to describe how EAI/IDN issues should be
handled in SIEVE.

(4) Work on a "Benefits of SIEVE" guide for client and server vendors that:
    (a) Describes the SIEVE protocol and its suite of extensions.
    (b) Explains the benefits of server-side filtering in practical terms.
    (c) Shows how client-side filtering can be migrated to SIEVE.

(5) Produce one or more informational RFCs containing a set of test
scripts and test email messages that are to be filtered by the scripts,
and the expected results of that filtering. This will serve as the basis
of a interoperability test suite to help determine the suitability of
moving the base specification and selected extensions to Draft status.
