The EAP working group will restrict itself to the following work items
in order to fully document and improve the interoperability of the
existing EAP protocol:

1. IANA considerations for EAP.
2. Type space extension to support an expanded Type space.
3. EAP usage model.
4. Threat model and security requirements.
5. Documentation of interaction between EAP and other layers.
6. Resolution of interoperability issues.
7. EAP state machine.
8. EAP keying framework.
9. EAP network selection problem definition

Items 1-6 were included within RFC 3748. Items 7-9 will be handled
as separate documents.

While the EAP WG is not currently chartered to standardize EAP
methods, with the publication of RFC 3748, the EAP WG will
assume responsibility for review of EAP methods requesting
a Type code allocation, as specified in the IANA considerations
section of RFC 3748.

When the current work items are completed, the WG may be
rechartered, or a new WG may be formed to standardize methods.
