The purpose of this BOF is to standardize a reliability protocols that 
can be used by a general class of applications to:

1) Seamlessly support server pooling

2) Support automatic receiver failover; when the chosen server fails
   redirect the message to another server

3) Allow implementation of flexible load assignment and balancing
   policies among servers

4) Allow servers to be added and removed from the pool transparently

5) Support a fully distributed name space for achieving a high degree
   of fault tolerance

As the target of this effort is to support the requirements of a large 
class of applications, we will begin by collecting requirements from a
variety of application areas.  Included in this group are telephony call
control, location registers and other services.  Architectural 
considerations are important.  An architectural framework will clarify 
building blocks - that is a set of easily separable course grained 
modular components.

To assist in this standardization process, the BOF will begin with
work on two documents.  The first will describe the requirements for 
reliable server pooling.  The second will be an architecture framework 
document. These two documents will be initially submitted as BOF drafts 
and subsequently proposed as Informational RFCs.

The WG will carry out protocol standardization by composing two RFCs
that specify:

   - a fault tolerant name translation service
   - a user interface for name to address translation, load sharing
     management and fault management.

RSpool will consult with other IETF working groups such as Reliable 
multicast, DNS extensions and Sigtran as appropriate.  We will not 
duplicate any of these efforts.
