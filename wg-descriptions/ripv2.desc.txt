RIP Version 2 and the Version 2 MIB was approved as a Proposed
   Standard in January 1993.  They were published as RFC 1388 and RFC 
1389.
   Since the mimimum required period has elapsed for a protocol
   to remain as a Proposed Standard, RIP V2 can now be considered for
   advancement to Draft Standard.

   The RIP Version 2 Working Group will prepare a recommendation to the
   IESG evalating the standards track status of RIP Version 2 and the
   RIP Version 2 MIB.  The recommendation will document implementation,
   interoperability and deployment experience as required by RFC 1264
   ``Routing Protocol Criteria.''

   This group is chartered to prepare revisions of ``RIP Version 2''
	(RFC 1388), ``RIP Version 2 MIB'' (RFC 1389), and the analysis
	document (RFC 1387) if necessary.

   The RIP Version 2 Working Group is further chartered to evaluate the
   proposal for ``Routing over Demand Circuits using RIP'' for standards
   track consideration.
