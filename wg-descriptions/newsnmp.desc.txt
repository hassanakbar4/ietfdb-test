The energy of the Network Management community in the IETF has been 
focused on finishing the work on SNMPv3 and SMIv2. These are more or 
less finished by now, and the community may have energy left over to 
look at other areas that need work.

This BOF is to identify those work items (if any) which make sense to 
work on within the IETF and where we have enough clarity of problem 
statement, interest and volunteers to charter the work to a WG.
