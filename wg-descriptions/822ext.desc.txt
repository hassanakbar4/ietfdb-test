This working group was chartered to extend the RFC 822 message format to
facilitate multi-media mail and alternate character sets.  RFCs 1341
and RFC 1342 document the Multi-Media Extensions for Internet Mail.

The working group will work to progress MIME to Draft Standard status
and provide a forum for the review of standards track content-type
specifications and the review of character set extensions to MIME.
