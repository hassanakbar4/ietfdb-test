This working group will consider revisions to the DS1 and DS3 MIBs
(currently published as Proposed Standards in RFC-1232 and RFC-1233) in
preparation for their consideration as Draft Standards.

Consistent with the IETF standards process, the working group is
chartered to consider only those changes to the DS1 and DS3 MIBs that
are based on implementation experience or on the need to align with
relevant ANSI T1M1 standards. In this context, the working group will
thoroughly document the implementation or alignment rationale for each
considered change.

All changes made by the working group will be consistent with the
existing SNMP framework and standards --- in particular, those
provisions of RFC-1155 regarding addition and deprecation of objects
in standard SNMP MIBs.

This working group will be a short-lived activity, involving a single
meeting, and will conclude its business no later than June 1992.
