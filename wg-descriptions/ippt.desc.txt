GOAL:

Very low cost methods of storing packet trace information in
routers and other devices along a network path have been recently
developed.  It is possible, using these technologies, to trace
individual packets back to their source (see, for instance, Snoeren
et al, Hash-Based IP Traceback,
http://www.acm.org/sigcomm/sigcomm2001/p1.html).

This BOF is focussed on the protocols required to support this
kind of trace information and whether IETF wishes to standardize
these kinds of protocols.
