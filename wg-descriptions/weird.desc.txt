The WEIRD working group will develop a set of web pages.  The
target audience is people new to the IETF and other Internet   
generalists. Content within the scope of the group includes:
current IETF WG and BOF activities, dependencies and
interrelationships among specific IETF WG and BOF activities, BOF
historical information, IAB / IESG / Secretariat issues and topics
of interest and their impact.

Content specifically out of scope includes: information
interpreting trends in Internet engineering and standards;
IETF-related information that is editorial in nature.

It is thought that by starting with concrete information of
general interest related to a topic the WG knows well (IETF
activities), the concept of doing web pages would be well-tested.
Future evaluations of the process could address the question of
re-examining the audience or content scope.

Web content will be developed in collaboration with the IETF
Secretariat using a mix of new material and material from existing
Web pages and FYI documents.  Information will be presented
in an online format suitable for the casual Internet user,
combining text and illustration.

In order to create a historic archive of the online data and to
make it more accessible to users who may have difficulty with
online access, the working group will capture at least one
snapshot of the web pages and publish it as an FYI RFC.
