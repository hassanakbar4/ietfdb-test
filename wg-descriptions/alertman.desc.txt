The Alert Management Working Group is chartered with defining and
developing techniques to manage the flow of asynchronously generated
information between a manager (NOC) and its remote managed entities.
The output of this group should be fully compatible with the letter and
spirit of SNMP (RFC 1067) and CMOT (RFC 1095).
