The goal of the Web Transaction Security Working Group is to develop
requirements and a specification for the provision of security services
to Web transaction, e.g., transactions using HyperText Transport 
Protocol
(HTTP). This work will proceed in parallel to and independently of the
development of non-security features in the HTTP Working Group. The
working group will prepare two documents for submission as Internet
Drafts; an HTTP Security Requirements Specification, and an HTTP
Security Protocol Specification. The latter will be submitted as a
Standards Track RFC.
