First, this BoF is not necessarily intended to result in a new 
working group. Rather, the intention is to stimulate some new thinking 
around the IPv4 Multicast Address Architecture and Allocation problem
(s). Specifically, allocation architectures, the causes for the land 
grab (e.g., no lightweight service discovery protocol), and to clean 
up the various older allocation strategies that, while documented in 
various RFCs, have never been widely deployed on the public Internet.
