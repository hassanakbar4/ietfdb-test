Public key technology -- certificates, the associated private keys, 
PKIs, etc. -- are hard to use and hard to deploy.  Some of that is 
merely perception, of course, but some of it is reality.  The question 
for this BoF, and a possible future working group is this:  what can 
the IETF do to make life easier?  Some hardware technologies may help, 
but of course the IETF doesn't develop such things. On the other hand, 
if we think they're part of the solution, some BCP we write can say so.

We assume that we're not missing any crucial over-the-wire protocols --
 though if we are, they'd be prime candidates for IETF work.  
Accordingly, an easycert working group would be charged with writing a 
few BCPs and possibly Informational RFCs.  So -- what are the titles 
of some such RFCs?  If you're a service provider (for any sort of 
service -- ISP, web site, ecommerce, etc.), what sort of advice should 
the IETF give you?  The vendors you buy from? Software developers?

The specific goal of the BoF is to figure out what the IETF can do.  
The desired outcome is a set of major charter points, including the 
titles of some RFCs we'd produce.
