With the emergence of new wireless technologies, there has been a 
proliferation of inter-access point mobility protocols. Most of these 
are achieved through the use of complicated link layers. Moreover,
these protocols do not allow for seamless mobility between different 
wireless technology access points.

The CRAPS BOF will examine whether a Working Group should be chartered 
to design a protocol facilitating seamless handover that is common
across most all types of radio access points and base stations. The goal
of the Working Group is to re-use existing IETF protocol where possible.
The output of the Working Group could be used by the various wireless 
and cellular SDOs, which would then enable users to seamlessly roam 
between different wireless technologies.

The wireless Internet should provide seamless roaming, at both the micro 
and macro mobility level, and perhaps a single protocol can provide 
both. In addition, the interfaces to AAA and QOS should be similar.
