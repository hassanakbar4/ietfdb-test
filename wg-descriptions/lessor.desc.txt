When an Internet Server stores a large amount of information, it is
necessary to offer server-side selecting, searching and ordering in
order to permit efficient download of interesting parts of the
information.  The functions used for selecting, searching and ordering
have many different properties and are often language sensitive.  In
order to use these functions in applications protocols a naming
convention and registry is needed.
 
This working group will create a standards track RFC defining a naming
convention and registry for "comparators."  This registry is intended
for use by the ACAP protocol and any future Internet-style application
protocols which offer server side sorting.
 
Definition of specific comparator functions is explicitly out of scope
for this working group.  The initial set of comparators in the
registry will include the three defined in the ACAP specification and
may include the current ISO standards in this area.
