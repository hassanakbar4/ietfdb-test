The purpose of this BOF is to introduce the Internet Kermit Service to
the IETF community.  The IKS is a public service providing the
installed base of telnet clients which support Kermit file transfer
protocol with the ability to transfer, convert, and manage files on
heterogeneous systems over a single connection which can easily pass
through transport level gateways, firewalls, and network address
translators.  

In order for the IKS to be successful it requires standard methods for
securing the connection with mutual authentication and bi-directional
encryption.  As Authentication and Encryption for Telnet sessions has
never progressed along the standards track a major goal for this BOF
is to provide an overview of the work that has been done over the last
several years in the area of authentication and encryption for Telnet
sessions.  It is hoped that the outcome of this BOF will be a working
group whose mission is to manage the completion of standards track
RFCs in the areas of Telnet Authentication and Encryption and the
Internet Kermit Service.
