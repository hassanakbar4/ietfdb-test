MIME, (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is currently a
   Draft Standard. MIME redefines the format of message bodies to
   allow multi-part textual and non-textual message bodies to be
   represented and exchanged without loss of information.  With the
   introduction of MIME as a Draft Standard it is now possible to
   define mappings between RFC 822 content-types and X.400 body parts.
   The MIME-MHS Interworking Working Group is chartered to develop
   these mappings, providing an emphasis on both interworking between
   Internet and MHS mail environments and also on tunneling through
   these environments. These mappings will be made in the context of an
   RFC 1148bis environment.
