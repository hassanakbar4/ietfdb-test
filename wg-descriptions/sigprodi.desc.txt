There has been a great deal of discussion about looking anew at the 
issue of quality of service-related signaling on IP networks.  


The IETF has already defined an explicit QoS signaling technology in 
RSVP and, some people would say, an implicit one in diffserv.  This BOF 
will examine the need to establish new signaling technologies in the 
light of the experiences with these existing ones.
