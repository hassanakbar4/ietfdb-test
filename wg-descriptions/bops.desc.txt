The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is fundamental to the
operation of the Internet. In recent years, the occurrence
of BGP related operational issues has increased, and
while overall understanding of the default-free routing
system has improved, there is still a long and growing
list of concerns. Among these are routing table growth rates,
dynamic properties of the routing system, and the effects
of routing policy on both the size and dynamic nature of
the routing table. In addition, new and innovative uses of
BGP, such as the use of BGP as a signaling protocol for
applications such as VPN, have created new and unexpected
operational issues. 

The purpose of the BGP OPS WG is continue and expand on
the original charter of the PTOMAINE WG. In particular,
the purpose of the BOPS WG is to consider and measure the
problem of routing table growth, and where appropriate,
to document the operational aspects of measurement,
policy, security, and VPN infrastructures.
