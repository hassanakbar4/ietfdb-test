NOTE: This WG joined with the ROLC WG to form the ION Working Group

The IP Over Asynchronous Transfer Mode Working Group will focus on the
issues involved in internetworking the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols over
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks.  The goal for the working
group is to produce standards for the TCP/IP Internet protocol suite.

The working group will develop models of IP over ATM internetworking
architectures; e.g. the classical Logical IP Subnet (LIS) over ATM.
The working group will develop protocols for encapsulation,
multicasting, addressing, address resolution, neighbor discovery, use
of published ATM Forum UNI signaling for IP call set up and connection
negotiation, and network management, as appropriate, to allow the
operation of internetwork protocols over an ATM network.  The working
group will submit these protocols for standardization.

The working group will coordinate its activities with the following
working groups:

1) Routing over Large Cloud (rolc), for next hop address resolution
   extensions to the classic LIS model,

2) Integrated Services Working Group (intserv) for coordinating the
   support of the enhanced Internet service model within an ATM LIS,

3) IP Next Generation Working Group (ipngwg) for IPv6 over ATM
   coordination, and

4) Resource Reservation Setup Protocol (rsvp) for coordinating the
   support IP signaling within an ATM LIS.

The working group will coordinate its work with other relevant
standards bodies (e.g., ATM Forum, ANSI T1S1) and make recommendations
to these organizations regarding the requirements for IP
internetworking where the current published ATM standards, practices,
or functionality do not meet the needs of internetworking.

The working group will not develop physical layer standards for ATM.
