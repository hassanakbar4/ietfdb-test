BGP begot BGPD, BGPD came together with ALE to beget CIDRD, CIDRD strayed
from the true path and the question is should it beget or just begone.

There is a widespread feeling that the CIDRD working group should be
concluded.  It has met its goals and has become more of a general
operations of the Internet catch-all.  The working group chairs and the
IESG concur in this feeling and the working group will terminate after the
fate of the document that it has in last call is determined.

This BOF will explore the options for the future of the activities that the
CIDRD working group has been supporting.  This discussion will include an
examination of the role of the IETF in the operations of the Internet.

Anyone who would like to be given time to speak at the session please send
a request to sob@harvard.edu.
