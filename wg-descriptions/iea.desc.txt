The IEA BOF will discuss internationalization of email addresses. 
Although domain names in email addresses (everything to the right of 
the "@") are already internationalized by RFC 3490, the mailbox name 
(everything to the left of the "@") is not. The BOF will consider 
various proposals that would allow users to have internationalized 
mailbox names and how they would work with existing Internet mail.
