The goal of this BOF is to discuss the need and scope of a new working
group whose charter will be to
 
-Identify monitoring interoperability requirements among ISPs with
respect to standardized infrastructure and sharing of data. 
-Identify components of an operational monitoring infrastructure
currently not addressed in the IETF, in particular, (i)storage, aging
and analysis of collected data and (ii) control plane functionality. 
-Provide guidelines to equipment vendors to help them meet the needs of
ISPs' monitoring infrastructure. 
-Make recommendations to other working groups standarizing different
elements of monitoring, e.g., IPPM, IPFIX and PSAMP, INCH, IDWG, etc.,
and define the context for applying these elements.
