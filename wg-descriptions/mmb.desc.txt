  The Multi-Media Bridge Working Group has the task of addressing
  the function of multi-media bridges within TCP/IP networks.  This
  is viewed as necessary at this time because of the proliferation
  of these devices.

  The first goal of the Group is to document the multi-media bridge
  technology and point out the issues raised by having these devices
  in a TCP/IP internet.  If there are problems which can be addressed
  the Group will work towards resolving them and documenting the
  solutions.
