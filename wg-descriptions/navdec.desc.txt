This BOF will explore the possibility of establishing a navdec working 
group.  The proposed charter for the working group follows:  

The working group will develop an informational RFC detailing the 
architecture and requirements for controlling PSTN (Public Switched
Telephone Network) Media Gateways from external control elements such as 
a media gateway controller. A PSTN media gateway is a network element 
that provides conversion between the audio information carried on 
telephone circuits and data packets carried over the Internet or over 
other packet networks.  This work will be done in consultation with 
other IETF working groups looking at similar issue.  The working group 
will also ensure that good information conduits exist with groups in 
other standards groups with expertise in the relevant PSTN technology.

This working group will also define standards track protocol(s) for 
controlling PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) Media Gateways from 
external control elements such as a media gateway controller.

Examples of PSTN media gateways are:
  * Trunking gateways that interface between the telephone network and
    a Voice over IP network. Such gateways typically manage a large
    number of digital virtual circuits. 
  * Access gateway that provide traditional analog or PRI line
    interfaces to a Voice over IP network.
  * Network Access Servers that can attach a "modem" to a telephone
    circuit and provide data access to the Internet.

This working group assumes a separation of call control where there is 
call control "intelligence" outside the media gateways that is handled 
by a media gateway controller. This allows for scalability and 
simplified management: many media gateways within a domain can be 
controlled by one media gateway controller.

This group will NOT work on media gateway controller to media gateway 
controller protocols, nor on media gateway to media gateway protocols.
