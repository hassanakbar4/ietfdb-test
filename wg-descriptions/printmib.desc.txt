The Printer MIB Working Group is chartered to develop a set of managed
objects for networked printers. These objects will be the minimum
necessary to provide the ability to monitor and control these systems,
providing fault, configuration and performance management, and will be
consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.

At its discretion, the working group may also define a small number of
unsolicited notifications (traps) which carry these managed objects.
However, the working group recognizes that traps are used sparingly in
the SNMP framework.

The working group recognizes that the area of networked printers is
quite diverse. However, the working group is specifically confined to
defining managed objects that instrument critical information about:

- printer engine

- interpreters

- media

- input sources

- output destinations

- I/O interfaces

Further, the working group is specifically prohibited from defining
managed objects that define instrumentation about:

- other marking technologies (e.g., those that mark onto film)

- fonts

- spooling

- print job management
