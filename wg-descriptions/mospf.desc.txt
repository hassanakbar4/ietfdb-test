This working group will extend the OSPF routing protocol so that it
will be able to efficiently route IP multicast packets. This will
produce a new (multicast) version of the OSPF protocol, which will be
as compatible as possible with the present version (packet formats and
most of the algorithms will hopefully remain unaltered).
