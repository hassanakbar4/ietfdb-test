Therefore, it is the purpose of this BOF to discuss the formation 
of an IETF WG to produce the following work items:

1) A Best Current Practices (BCP) RFC describing how to obtain
the Simple Gateway and Simple Security features of NAT without
performing address translation.  This document is intended for home
gateway manufacturers and other standards bodies that define home
gateway functionality.

2) A Standards-Track (PS) RFC that describes an IPv6 Network
Address Translation mechanism that provides the Simple Security and
Address Independence benefits of IPv4 NAT, while minimizing the
problems caused by IPv4 NAT.  This solution is expected to involve a
one-to-one, algorithmic address mapping mechanism with no port
mapping.  It may or may not include a checksum-neutral mapping
algorithm and/or a cryptographic mapping mechanism.

3) Updates to the BEHAVE mechanisms (STUN, TURN, etc.), if needed, to
allow applications to successfully traverse IPv6 NAT devices, as
defined in (2).  Alternatively, this work could be chartered in
BEHAVE and done in consultation with this group.

4) An Informational RFC that describes the enterprise network
requirements for Topology Hiding and Multihoming that are currently
met by IPv4 NAT devices.  Once these requirements are well-understood,
the WG may be rechartered to work on NAT-based or non-NAT-based
solutions to these problems.
