The proxy services area defines protocols and API's that enable proxies 
extend their services beyond protocol relays and caching.  The working 
group will develop documents defining the architecture, policy model and 
elements, and terminology. Protocols for delivering new services and 
policies related to their execution will be defined and developed.  
Other protocols, allowing the services to communicate information about 
the protocol elements of the proxied protocol, will be developed. A 
security architecture for the administration of proxies with third party 
services will be defined. The API to core services, such as protocol 
control and use, will be defined.
