The Mobile IP Working Group has developed routing support to permit IP
nodes (hosts and routers) using either IPv4 or IPv6 to seamlessly
"roam" among IP subnetworks and media types.  The Mobile IP method
supports transparency above the IP layer, including the maintenance of
active TCP connections and UDP port bindings. Where this level of
transparency is not required, solutions such as DHCP and dynamic DNS
updates may be adequate and techniques such as Mobile IP not needed.

The WG moving forward will focus on deployment issues in Mobile IP and
provide appropriate protocol solutions to address known deficiencies
and shortcomings. For example, the wireless/cellular industry is
considering using Mobile IP as one technique for IP mobility for
wireless data. The working group will endeavor to gain an
understanding of data service in cellular systems such as
GPRS, UMTS, CDMA2000, and interact with other standards bodies that
are trying to adopt and deploy Mobile IP WG protocols in these
contexts.  In order to provide a complete solution and a set of
protocols that can be used as a roadmap for widespread deployment, the
following work needs to be accomplished by this WG. In the near term,
the WG needs to work on:

- Use of NAIs to identify mobile users/nodes.

- Specifying how Mobile IP should use AAA functionality to support

  inter-domain and intra-domain mobility.

- Develop solutions for IPv4 private address spaces for the scenarios
  needed for deployment.

- Documenting any requirements specific to cellular/wireless networks.

In the longer term, the WG needs to address:

- QoS in the mobile IP environment using diff-serv and/or 
int-serv/RSVP.

- Location Privacy.

The Working Group will ensure that solutions proposed for these problem
domains are suitable for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.
