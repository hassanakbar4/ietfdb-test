The IETF Chair has gathered a team called PESCI - Process Evolution
Committee of the IETF.

This team has (this will be true when the BOF rolls around) published a
document which contains two parts:

- A list of principles that the committee feels should underlie the 
search for improvements to the IETF process

- A list of next steps that the committee feels should be undertaken in
order to get the necessary next process reform steps done.

The BOF seeks input on these two topics, and is expected to conclude 
that either the next steps suggested by PESCI are untenable, or that 
the next steps should be pursued (possibly modified based on feedback).

The PESCI team will report the conclusions from the BOF in the plenary.
