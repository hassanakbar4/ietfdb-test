     The SNA NAU Services MIB Working Group is chartered to define a
     set of managed objects for PU type 2.0, and LU type 1, 2, and 3
     devices for SNA networks.  These objects will be the minimum
     necessary to provide the ability to monitor and control those
     devices, providing fault, configuration, and performance
     management, and will be consistent with the SNMP framework and
     existing SNMP standards.

     The working group will consider existing enterprise-specific MIB
     modules that define objects which support management of these
     devices.  It will also make sure that its work is aligned with the
     SNA DLC Services MIB Working Group, due to the close relationship
     between the devices being worked on by the two groups.

     The working group recognizes that managed objects for other
     components (e.g., PU Type 4, PU Type 5, LU Types 1, 3, 4, 6.2
     (APPC), APPN EN, APPN NN and APPI) may need to be identified in
     the future.  These objects are out of scope for the current
     charter; however, once the group completes its charter, a
     new charter identifying some or all of these components may be
     considered.
