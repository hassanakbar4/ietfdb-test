Thare are a number of short mail-related individual submissions which
appear not to require the review of a full working group, but would
benefit from some review and a sense of rough concensus.  Each draft
on the agenda will be allocated a fixed (and enforced) time limit for a
brief presentation and technical debate.  At the end of the time
limit, the rough concensus of the room will be measured to see if the
draft in question should go standards track expediously, standards
track with revisions, experimental, punt to WG, defer or discourage.

The success of this effort is likely to depend on the number of
participants who read the drafts in advance.  Most of these drafts are
short.  Draft authors are requested to prepare one overhead
transparency to summarize their proposals.  Some of the drafts listed
below could get IESG approval prior to the BOF, in which case they
will be dropped from the agenda.  The purpose of including drafts in
last call on the list is that if they're not approved by the time the
BOF occurs, then the BOF may give review feedback to ADs which could
help speed approval.
