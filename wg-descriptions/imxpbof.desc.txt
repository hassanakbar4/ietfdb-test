This BOF will discuss IMXP, an application-layer routing 
infrastructure,
and how it may be used to support messaging and presence for 
applications requiring different levels of service.

A number of messaging systems operate over the Internet (and provide
useful service in doing so); however, each of these services relies on 
a 
set of quality of service assumptions that limit its usefulness to 
other 
applications. For example, the SMTP-based infrastructure provides 
extraordinary reach, but is inappropriate for either instant messaging 
(which requires very low latency between posting and delivery) and 
hardened messaging (which requires audit trails, reliability 
guarantees,
et&c). Similarly, although presence information was readily accessible
on Internet-connected systems years ago -- when a user had an open 
session to a well-known multi-user system, friends and colleagues could 
easily tell -- there is no standard way to make this information known 
to peers.
