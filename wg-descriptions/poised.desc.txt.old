       The goal of this Working Group is to examine the Internet 
       standards process and the responsibilities of the IAB, with 
       attention to the relationship between the IAB and IETF/IESG.
     
       The need for this Working Group was suggested during discussions
       at the July 1992 IETF.  This led to a request from the Internet 
       Society president to form such a Working Group.

       The Working Group will consider the following matters:

         1. Procedures for making appointments to the Internet
            Architecture Board.

         2. Procedures for resolving disagreements among IETF, IESG and
            IAB in matters pertaining to the Internet Standards.

         3. Methods for assuring that for any particular Internet
            Standard, procedures have been followed satisfactorily by all
            parties so that everyone with an interest has had a fair
            opportunity to be heard.


       The Working Group will begin with a review of the procedures for making 
       IAB appointments as documented in RFC 1358 and a review of 
       the standards-making process documented in RFC 1310.

       The Working Group has a goal of issuing a final report in time for IESG 
       consideration and publication as an RFC before the ISOC Board Trustee's 
       meeting in December 1992.  Given the compressed timescale, the Working
       Group will conduct most of its deliberations by electronic mail on the
       POISED Working Group mailing list.   There will also be a preliminary
       report and discussions at the November 1992 IETF meeting in Washington,
       DC.

       This will be a normal IETF Working Group, i.e., the mailing list and all
       discussions will be completely open.
