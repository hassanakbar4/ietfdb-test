The IPSEC protocols are very strong; however, this strength poses 
problems for other parts of the Internet. For example, many different 
people have legitimate needs to see port numbers. Network engineers need 
to understand what sorts of traffic are being carried, firewalls have to 
enforce security policies, etc. This BoF will discuss variants of ESP 
that can allow more of the packet to be exposed.
