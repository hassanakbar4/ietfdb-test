The Token Ring Remote Monitoring MIB Working Group is chartered to
produce a new MIB specification that extends the facilities of the
existing Remote Monitoring (RMON) MIB (RFC 1271) for use in monitoring
IEEE 802.5 Token Ring networks.

The Token Ring RMON MIB extensions will be developed in the same
architectural framework as the existing Ethernet-based RMON MIB.  The
original RMON MIB architecture was designed with the intention of
incorporating MIB extensions devoted to monitoring other network media
types.  This Token Ring activity is the first attempt at such
integration.

In creating the Token Ring Extensions, the working group will, wherever
possible, conform to terminology and concepts defined by relevant IEEE
standards.  It may be that a MIB devoted to monitoring may need to
expand on the IEEE objects and definitions.  Such modifications will
be accompanied by a detailed rationale.

All work produced by the Token Ring Remote Monitoring Working Group
will be consistent with the existing SNMP network management framework
and standards.
