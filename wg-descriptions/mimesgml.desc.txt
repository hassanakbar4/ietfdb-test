The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) community is actively
addressing certain issues that relate to interoperability but not those
directly related to electronic mail.

This working group will address e-mail issues and concerns to directly
support the exchange of SGML in MIME e-mail.  These issues include the
structure of  MIME document that will contain both SGML document markup
and the various definitions, including handling of public and private
identifiers.

The working group's effort is NOT intended to address the syntax and 
structure of SGML.  Previous work in this area, ISO 9069, SGML Document 
Interchange Format (SDIF) and SGML Open Technical Resolution 9401 will 
be addressed as interface requirements that may be supported through 
e-mail.
