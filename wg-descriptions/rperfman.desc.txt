Work in several IETF working groups addresses issues relevant to remote 
performance management.  These include the ippm, bmwg, rmonmib, and 
disman working groups.  The purpose of this BOF is threefold.  First, 
it 
will help in assessing the need for additional work in the area not 
already covered by existing work items.  Secondly, it will aid in 
determining whether there is sufficient interest (and resources).  
Finally, it will give interested parties an opportunity to voice their 
views on what would be an appropriate home for this work, whether under 
the existing charter of an existing WG, as an extension to some WG's 
charter, or as a separate working group.
