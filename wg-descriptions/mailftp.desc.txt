Electronic mail often provides the only means of data transfer between
two systems.  Hence it would be convenient to specify standard mechanisms
for file transmission and retrieval using Internet standard electronic mail

the need to synchronize various X.400 operations tables, and will develop
a plan for specifying a general mechanism to support file access transfer
and synchronization using Internet mail. 10/19/93 mw
