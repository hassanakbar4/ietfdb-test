The SMTP Extensions Working Group is chartered to develop extensions to 
the
base SMTP protocol (RFC821) to facilitate the more efficient 
transmission of 8
bit text and binary data.  Among the extensions to be considered to SMTP 
are the
elimination of the ASCII text character restriction and line length 
restriction
to allow the sending of arbitrary 8 bit character sets, and the 
definition of
mechanisms to facilitate binary transmission, and extensions to the
negotiation sequence to facilitate batch transmission.
