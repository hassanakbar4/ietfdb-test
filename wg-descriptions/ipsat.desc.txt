The goal of the IPSAT BoF is to discuss the problem of supporting
the Internet Protocol (IP) over GEO satellite links.  The potential
working group will prepare a framework and requirements document
describing a typical satellite infrastructure and how an IP based
network might be architected to utilize this infrastructure. It will
also address the service interface between IP and the satellite link
level (DVB or other).
