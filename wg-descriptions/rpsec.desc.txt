The lack of a common set of security requirements and methods for
 routing protocols has resulted in a wide variety of security
 mechanisms for individual routing protocols. Ongoing work on
 requirements for the next generation routing system and future work on
 the actual mechanisms for it will require well documented routing
 security requirements.

 The products of this working group will be used by routing protocol
 designers to ensure adequate coverage of security in the future,
 including well known and possible threats.

 The scope of work is limited to router-to-router protocols only for
 both unicast and multicast systems, and does NOT include
 host-to-router protocol such as IGMP, ICMP, ARP, or ND. It is also a
 non-goal at this point to produce new or change the current security
 mechanisms in the existing routing protocols.

 The RPSEC working group is charged with the following tasks:

 - Document threat models for routing systems

 - Document security requirements for routing systems

 - Document security analysis and requirements for specific routing
     protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP)

 - Provide a common area for discussion between security and routing
     experts on the topic of securing the routing system

 Possible Future Work

 - Evaluate and document existing and proposed routing security
     mechanisms with respect to established RPSEC requirements

 - Recommend mechanism(s)
