The URN WG's Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) describes a
generalized architecture for 'top down' resolution of identifiers such
as URIs.  This works well when a (software) client wants or needs to
dynamically determine the explicit authoritative delegation of 
resolution.  However, there are times when it is desirable to 
incorporate other elements of contextual control information in 
determining, for example, the  "appropriate copy" of a resource -- 
preferrentially finding a "local" copy of a journal rather than 
re)purchasing one from the authoritative publisher.  This is generally
applicable to all URI resolution, but it is more specific than "web 
caching".  Software systems being built to solve this in today's 
deployed systems are using specialized, non-interoperable, non-
scalable approaches.

Some current experimentation and a straw proposal are described below.

This BoF is chartered to determine if there is interest/wherewithal to
determine a standard vehicle to process contextualized resolution that

   a) is not application- or protocol-specific and
   b) ties in with global resolution systems (such as DDDS) in order 
      to preserve authoritative resolution chains, where applicable

Beyond the "appropriate copy" scenario, this should equally be 
applicable in non-document contexts -- e.g., IP-telephony (enterprise
dialing schemes taking precedence over, but linked to, global 
numbering).

While the focus of this BoF is on standardized resolution 
steps/mechanisms, not "metadata" or "knowledge transactions", 
discussion 
must reflect that "context" generalizes beyond location/area (e.g., to 
"who's paying for this", etc).
