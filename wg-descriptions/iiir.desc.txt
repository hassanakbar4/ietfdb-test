The Integration of Internet Information Resources Working Group (IIIR)
is chartered to facilitate interoperability between Internet
information services, and to develop, specify, and align protocols
designed to integrate the plethora of Internet information services
(WAIS, ARCHIE, Prospero, etc.) into a single ``virtually unified
information service'' (VUIS). Such protocols would include, but are not
limited to, update protocols for distributed servers, a ``query routing
protocol'' to pass queries between existing services, protocols for
gateways between existing and future services, and standard exchange
formats (perhaps based on Z39.50) for cross-listing specific
information.

Also, where necessary, IIIR will create technical documentation for
protocols used for information services in the Internet.
