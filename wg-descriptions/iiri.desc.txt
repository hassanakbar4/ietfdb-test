What's the main purpose of Internet? Information retrieval and 
exchanging. But what's the most important principle to judge a network? 
Maybe communication speed. For common user, they can't feel search 
service in GB Internet is better than that in MB networks. The great 
progress of Internet didn't bring the great improvement in its main 
service.

Now Internet is going far and far from their original aim, "knowledge 
source of human being", and transforming into a jumbled information 
sea. Many experts are mainly concerned with "physical Internet", but 
now we need pay more attention to "information Internet".

Information retrieval services may be the most important service of 
Internet, but there is till no a special work group for it. Current 
commercial search engines meet many bottleneck problems in coverage and 
recency. Its service is far from our expectation. It's just a web pages 
search system. We can also get information from many other information 
resources such as special databases, FTP search engine, P2P, etc. So a 
work group for Internet information retrieval system is very necessary. 
We have proposed a basic information retrieval frame, DRIS (Domain 
Resource Integration System), for this issue. Any related topic could 
be discussed in this group.
