The Uniform Resource Identifiers Working Group is chartered to
define a set of standards for the encoding of system-independent
resource location and identification information for the use of
Internet information services.

This working group is expected to produce a set of documents that
specify standard representations of Uniform Resource Locators
(URLs) for encoding location and
access information across multiple information systems, Unique Resource
Serial Numbers (URSNs) which specify a standardized method for encoding
unique resource identification information for Internet resources, and
Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) which specify a standardized
method for encoding combined resource identification and location
information systems to be used for resource discovery and access
systems in an Internet environment.  Such standards
are expected to build upon the document discussed at the UDI BOF
session held during the 24th IETF meeting in Boston

Such a set of standards will provide a framework that allows the
Internet user to specify the location and access information for files
and other resources on the Internet, users and network-based
tools to uniquely identify specific resources on the Internet, and
the creation and operation of resource discovery and access
systems for the Internet.  The security of such resource discovery
services will also be considered to be an integral part of the work
of this group.
