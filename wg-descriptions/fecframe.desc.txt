The object of this group is to develop standards for using forward 
error correction (FEC) codes with applications in the Internet to 
provide protection against packet loss. The group will develop a
framework for application of FEC codes to arbitrary packet flows over
unreliable transport protocols over both IP multicast and unicast. The
group will build on the work of the RMT working group in the form of 
the FEC Building Block developed there to ensure that the framework
developed can support multiple FEC codes and maintain independence
between FEC codes and content delivery protocols. Note: framework
here is a protocol framework, with a design to be determined, but 
suitable for interoperable implementations. It is not used in the 
sense often used by IETF of a document akin to requirements.

A primary objective of this framework is to support FEC for streaming
media. The group will coordinate closely with AVT and MMUSIC working
groups to ensure that this use-case is fully specified both in terms of
interactions with RTP/RTCP and application layer signalling. The group 
will also coordinate with the DCCP working group, at least, 
considering that transport's role in streaming media.

The group will work with the RMT working group to ensure that the FEC
Building Block defined in RMT supports both the RMT use-cases (object
delivery over multicast) and the more general FEC protection of IP 
flows over unreliable unicast and multicast transport. The group will 
also consider developing its charter to include for proposals for 
standardization of specific FEC codes - taking on this work from the 
RMT working group - including consideration of their areas of 
applicability and generality.

Specification of hybrid schemes involving both retransmission and
forward error correction will be out of scope of the group. However the
group should consider of whether work on such schemes should be
considered in a future phase.
