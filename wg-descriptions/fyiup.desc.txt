The FYI Updates Working Group will oversee the work of updating
two existing FYI documents.  These documents are two that the
User Services Area has determined are out of date, but contain
information that would be useful to the Internet community if it
were updated.

The first document will be:

  FYI 7: FYI on Questions and Answers: Answers to commonly asked
         "experienced Internet user" questions.

 

The Working Group will provide an online and in-person focus for
discussing and coordinating the work of revising these FYIs.
