The TCP Client Identity Protocol Working Group is chartered to define
a protocol for returning the identity of the user initiating a TCP
connection.  When a client on host A initiates a TCP connection to
host B, host B may query a server on host A to determine the identity
of the client on host A.  The primary purpose of this protocol is to
record the identity of requesters initiating a connection.
 
This work is a clarification and standardization of the Experimental
Protocol currently published as RFC 931.
