X.400 management domains are being deployed today on the Internet. There 
is a
need for coordination of the various efforts to insure that they can
interoperate and collectively provide an Internet-wide X.400 message 
transfer
service connected to the existing Internet mail service. The overall 
goal of
this group is to insure interoperability between Internet X.400 
management
domains and the existing Internet mail service. The specific task of 
this
group is to produce a document that specifies the requirements and 
conventions
of operational Internet PRMDs.
