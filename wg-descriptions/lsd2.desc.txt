The purpose of this BOF is to examine the question of deploying
LDAP services beyond the context of a single service provider.

Issues that can arise include:

- Methods of finding LDAP services
- Bindings between LDAP services and LDAP servers
- Cross-service searches
- Adaptations to differing schemas

Some approaches that are being tried in practice are presented.
