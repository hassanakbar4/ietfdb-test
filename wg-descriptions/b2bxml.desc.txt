Description: Recently there is a strong movement for encoding data for 
web based information exchange, such as in Business to Business 
communications, using XML to encode the data in the communications. 
Strategies are evolving, such as SOAP, but the problem specification 
and 
protocol requirements need to be clarified for enforcement by the IETF 
community. This BOF discusses this problem space to set forth the 
problem area requirements. Examining existing techniques will be done 
to 
assure the problem space is well defined.
