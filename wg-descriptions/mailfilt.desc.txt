A variety of delivery-time mechanisms for filtering and disposing 
of messages have long been available for messages delivered via 
SMTP. Such filtering schemes have become increasingly important with 
the advent of increased volumes of mail and newer Internet-standard 
mail access models with richer delivery capabilities. In this
increasingly complex delivery loop, it is desirable to have an
architecture-independent, interoperable filtering language for use 
in the MTA delivery process written and adopted as an Internet 
Standard.

The working group will specify a simplified but generalizable 
mail filtering language for filtering messages at the time of 
final delivery. It is designed to be independent of protocol, 
though clearly appropriate to RFC822/821 message handling, and
implementable on either a mail client or mail server, though
specifically intended for MTA delivery-side

functionality.  It is meant to be extensible, simple, and independent 
of access protocol, mail architecture, and operating system.

Because there has been considerable past work on specific MTA 
Filtering proposals, specifically the SIEVE draft, and there is 
a considerable body of working implementation experience in this 
area, the proposed Working Group anticipates fully completing 
the proposed Internet Standard in a relatively timely manner as
reflected in the goals and milestones.
