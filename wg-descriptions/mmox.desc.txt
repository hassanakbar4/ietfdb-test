We do not believe there will be conflicts between this proposed
working group and existing working groups in terms of charter. In
terms of scheduling, there may be some discussion regarding the use of
SIP/RTP as a signaling infrastructure and transport of real-time data.
If possible, it would be nice to avoid conflicts between this BoF
session and proceedings of the AVT, MMUSIC, SIP and SIMPLE working
groups. That being said, it's unlikely we'll be presenting detailed
technical recommendations at this early stage, we are simply
interested in insuring that experts in the subject matter of these
groups have the maximal opportunity to discuss the applicability of
SIP/RTP to MMO applications.
