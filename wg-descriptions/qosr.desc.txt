This working group is chartered to define a framework and techniques
for Quality of Service (QoS) Routing in the Internet. QoS Routing
allows the network to determine a path that supports the QoS needs of
one or more flows in the network. The path chosen may not be the
"traditional shortest path" that is typically computed based on current
metrics and policies. The group's work will focus on how to select and
maintain packet forwarding paths capable of meeting specific service
class objectives. In particular, the techniques will specify what
extensions and adaptations to routing and QoS setup protocols are
required to support QoS routing and new packet handling techniques that
may be needed to avoid packet loops for QoS flows. While it is not
intended, this may also spawn the development of new routing protocols
that can specifically address QoS routing. The WG will identify topics
and issues in QOS routing which require additional research.
 
The WG needs to work closely with other routing protocol working groups
such as OSPF, IDR, BGP, and IDMR. A close relationship with the
RSVP,IntServ, and ISSLL working groups is also needed to understand the
QoS signalling and specification.
