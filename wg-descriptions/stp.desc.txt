The proliferation of networking technologies and applications bring 
new promises and challenges to the Internet. One such challenge is 
how to develop and manage a heterogeneous and colossal networking
environment? Specifically, how to manage a network that consists of
IPv4, RFC1918, IPv6, IPSec, mobile IP, and a variety of applications
that use multiple IP transports, TCP, UDP, and Multicast? The Secure
Transport Proxy Working Group (STP) is chartered to specify a generic
mechanism to proxy IP transports in a secure manner.

The protocol will evolve from the existing work done by the
Authenticated Firewall Traversal Working Group (AFT). It will focus 
on transport proxy mechanisms that are secure, scalable, efficient 
and flexible. The protocol will be specifically designed for
bi-directional establishment of TCP, UDP and Multicast proxy channels
over a heterogeneous network environment, enabling application 
protocols to securely pass through firewalls.
