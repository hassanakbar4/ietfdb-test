The IETF BEEP working group shall develop a standards-track application
protocol framework for connection-oriented, asynchronous 
request/response interactions.

The framework must permit multiplexing of independent request/response
streams over a single transport conneciton, supporting both textual and
binary messages.

The working group will use BXXP (as described in 
draft-mrose-bxxp-framework and draft-mrose-bxxp-tcpmapping) as its 
starting point.  Although not encouraged, non-backwards-compatible 
changes to BXXP will be acceptable if the working group determines that 
the changes are required to meet the group's technical objectives and 
the group clearly documents the reasons for making them.
