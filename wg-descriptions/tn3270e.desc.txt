Present specifications for access to 3270 and 5250 based applications 
over TCP/IP require improvement to become more commercially viable. 
Security, Service Location, Response Time, and Session Balancing are 
improvement examples.
 
The WG will drive to update and extend the standards specifications 
proposed in rfc1647 and rfc1205 so that they fully support 3270 and 
5250 
style access to host (S/390 and AS/400) applications respectively in 
today's environments.
 
Consideration will be given to work already in progress on protocols 
for
accessing 3270 and 5250 based applications over TCP/IP.
 
Three protocol documents will be produced.
 
Deliverables

1. A revised version of rfc1647 (tn3270e) including clarifications of 
   the protocol, and security considerations.  The revised rfc1647 will 
   be submitted to the IESG for advancement of the tn3270e protocol to 
 
   draft standard status. Currently it is a proposed standard.
 
2. A new standards track document defining options for the tn3270e 
   protocol. Such options are: IPDS printing, response time monitoring, 
   error reporting, session balancing, service location, and security.
 
3. A new standards track document defining enhancements to the tn5250
   protocol. This new protocol will be called tn5250e. This is not 
   Display Station Passthru but printing, LU assignment, service 
   location, and security.
