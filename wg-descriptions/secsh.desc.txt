The goal of the working group is to update and standardize the popular
SSH protocol. SSH provides support for secure remote login, secure file
transfer, and secure TCP/IP and X11 forwardings. It can automatically
encrypt, authenticate, and compress transmitted data.  The working
group will attempt to assure that the SSH protocol

 o  provides strong security against cryptanalysis and protocol 
attacks,

 o  can work reasonably well without a global key management or
    certificate infrastructure,

 o  can utilize existing certificate infrastructures (e.g., DNSSEC,
    SPKI, X.509) when available,

 o  can be made easy to deploy and take into use,

 o  requires minimum or no manual interaction from users,

 o  is reasonably clean and simple to implement.

The resulting protocol will operate over TCP/IP or other reliable but
insecure transport. It is intended to be implemented at the application
level.
