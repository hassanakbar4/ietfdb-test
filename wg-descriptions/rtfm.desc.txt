This working group has three main objectives:

* Consider current issues in traffic flow measurement, such as

  - Security issues relating to both traffic measuring devices
    and to the data they produce.

  - Policy issues relating to traffic measurement and usage
    accounting, for example any requirements these may place on
    emerging network protocols

  - Existing work in traffic flow measurement, including that of
    IETF Working Groups such as bmwg/ippm, rsvp and rmonmib, as
    well as that by vendors and independent researchers

* Produce an improved Traffic Flow Model considering at least the
  following needs:

  - wider range of measurable quantities, e.g. those relating to
      IPv6, and to class of service
  - simpler ways to specify flows of interest
  - better ways to control access to measured flow data
  - strong focus on data reduction capabilities
  - efficient hardware implementation

* Develop the RTFM Architecture and Meter MIB as 'standards track'
  documents with the IETF.
