The cellular community is now standardizing the next generation cellular
systems. These systems will use IP to deliver telephony to coming mobile
phones, to allow end-to-end IP telephony. As cellular bandwith is 
expensive, radio spectrum efficiency is of outmost importance and thus
the IP/UDP/RTP headers must be compressed over the air. 3GPP has 
specified the requirements for the needed header compression scheme and 
it has been shown that no current header compression scheme in the IETF 
can satisfy these requirements. CRTP [RFC-2508] is the closest candidate 
but is not sufficiently robust against errors on the link, i.e., CRTP 
cannot deliver acceptable performance at the anticipated error rates. It 
is likely that the number of users of cellular IP telephony will be 
larger than the current number of people using TCP/IP, therefore it is 
important that a suitable header compression scheme is developed.

The BOF will outline the relevant properties of the cellular links, the
requirements, and will explain why CRTP fails. One or more proposals for
a suitable header compression scheme will be presented, and finally we
will discuss if and how the IETF will work on standardizing a suitable
header compression scheme.
