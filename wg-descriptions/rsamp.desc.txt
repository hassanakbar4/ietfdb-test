The BOF will examine the need for a standard set of capabilities for
network elements to sample traffic. One motivation to standardize
these capabilities comes from the requirement for measurement-based
support for network management and control across domains.
This requires domain wide consistency in the types of sampling schemes
available, the manner in which the resulting measurements are
presented, and consequently, consistency of the interpretation that
can be put on them. The capabilities are positioned as suppliers of
packet samples to higher level consumers, including both remote
collectors and applications, and on board applications.
