The Domain Name System Security Working Group (DNSSEC) will ensure
enhancements to the secure DNS protocol to protect the dynamic update
operation of the DNS. Specifically, it must be possible to detect the
replay of update transactions and it must be possible to order update
transactions. Clock synchronization should be addressed as well as all
of the dynamic update specification.

Some of the issues to be explored and resolved include

o scope of creation, deletion, and updates for both names and zones

o protection of names subject to dynamic update during zone transfer

o scope of KEY resource record for more specific names in wildcard
  scope

o use of or relationship with proposed expiration resource record

One essential assumption has been identified: data in the DNS is
considered public information. This assumption means that discussions
and proposals involving data confidentiality and access control are
explicitly outside the scope of this working group.
