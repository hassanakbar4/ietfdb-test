There is significant interest in the use of XML-based technologies
to manage and configure IP-based networks and networking equipment.
This BOF will discuss the high-level requirements for a network
configuration mechanism, and will explore how the existing 
proprietary and standards-based XML technologies, such SOAP, WBEM 
and SyncML, could be used to meet those requirements.  Based on 
that discussion, we will determine whether we should pursue any
IETF work in this area.
