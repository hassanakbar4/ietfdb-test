     The Interfaces MIB Working Group is chartered to accomplish two tasks.

     First, to develop a collection of managed objects which model the
     relation between different entities in the data link and physical
     layers.  The working group will explore different modeling
     approaches in order to develop a collection of objects which is
     both correct in the modeling sense and has an acceptable impact (if
     any) on the interfaces table from MIB-II and all media MIB modules
     on the standards track or under development by a working group.
     The objects defined by the working group will be consistent with
     the SNMP framework.

     Second, to prepare a recommendation to the IESG evaluating RFC-1229 
     (the interface-extensions MIB), RFC-1231 (the token-ring MIB), RFC-1304
     (the SMDS MIB), and RFC-1398 (the ethernet-like MIB) with respect to the
     standards track.

     The recommendation will document implementation, interoperability,
     and deployment experience.  If these experiences suggest that
     changes should be made to the documents, new drafts may be
     prepared.

     For RFCs 1229, 1231, and 1304, the recommendation will report one
     of four outcomes for each RFC:
	  
	- that the RFC should be advanced from Proposed to Draft 
        Standard status, without changes (if no problems are found);

	- that a draft prepared by the working group should replace
	the RFC, and be designated a Draft Standard (if only minor changes
	are made);
	
	- that a draft prepared by the working group should
	replace the RFC, and be designated a Proposed Standard (if major
	changes or feature enhancements are made); or,
	
	- that the RFC should be designated as Historic (if this technology
	is problematic).

     For RFC 1398, the recommendation will report one of five outcomes:

        - that the RFC should be advanced from Draft Standard to Standard
        status, without changes (if no problems are found);
     
        - that a draft prepared by the working group should replace 
        the RFC, and be designated a Standard (if only editorial changes 
        are made);
     
        - that a draft prepared by the working group should replace 
        the RFCs, and be designated a Draft Standard (if only minor 
        changes are made);
     
        - that a draft prepared by the working group should replace 
        the RFC, and be designated a Proposed Standard (if major changes 
        or feature enhancements are made); or,
     
        - that the RFC should be designated as Historic (if this 
        technology is problematic).
