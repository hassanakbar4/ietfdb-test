The purposes of this BOF will be to 

1.  Explore technical issues associated with the creation
    of an Internet Nearcast Service.

2.  Determine what related efforts exist.

3.  Gauge interest in participating in the work.

4.  Possibly gauge concensus in creating a working group.


This BOF is a bit preliminary, since the technical ideas
are only sketched out at this point.  I envision, assuming
things go well at the BOF, that an internet-draft will be
created between Memphis and Munich, and that this internet-draft
will be the basis for a more "serious" BOF in Munich.  It
is more likely that the second BOF would make the decision
about forming a working group.
