The SNA NAU MIB Working Group is chartered to define a set of managed
objects for SNA Network Accessible Units. These includes PUs(Physical
Units) such as type 2.0 and 2.1 and LUs(Logical Units) such as type 1,
2, 3, and 6.2. These objects will be the minimum necessary to provide
the ability to monitor and control those devices, providing fault,
configuration, and performance management, and will be consistent with
the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.
 
The working group has completed the MIBs for base SNA NAU functions and
advanced functions for LU Type 6.2 or APPC (Advanced Program-to-Program
Communication). With the exception of the current work in enhancing the
SNA NAU MIB, the focus of the working group will be developing two
additional MIBs for managing APPN (Advanced Peer-to-Peer Networking)
and HPR (High Performance Routing) nodes.

The working group will make sure that its work is aligned with the SNA
DLC MIB Working Group, due to the close relationship between the
devices being worked on by the two groups.
