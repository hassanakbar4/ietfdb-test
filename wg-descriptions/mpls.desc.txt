The MPLS working group is responsible for standardizing a base
technology for using label switching and for the implementation of
label-switched paths over various packet based link-level
technologies, such as Packet-over-Sonet, Frame Relay, ATM, and
LAN technologies (e.g. all forms of Ethernet, Token Ring, etc.).
This includes procedures and protocols for the distribution of
labels between routers and encapsulation.

The working group is also responsible for specifying the necessary
management objects (e.g. as part of MIB modules) and OAM techniques for
the functionality specified in the base MPLS technology.

The first generation of the MPLS standards are largely complete,
and the current WG work items are:

 - Define requirements, mechanisms and protocol extensions for
point-to-multipoint (P2MP) MPLS

 - Define requirements, mechanisms and protocol extensions for
traffic engineered point-to-multipoint (P2MP) MPLS, including
soft preemption

 - Define requirements and mechanisms for MPLS OAM

 - Define an overall OAM framework for MPLS applications

 - MPLS-specific aspects of traffic engineering for multi-areas/multi-AS
in cooperation with the CCAMP WG

 - Determine (with CCAMP) what procedures are appropriate for evaluating
proposals to extend the MPLS and GMPLS protocols, and document these

 - Document current implementation practices for MPLS load sharing

 - Include extensions to the MPLS WG protocols and RFCs necessary to
create an MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS TP). The work on the MPLS TP will
be coordinated between the working groups (eg, MPLS, CCAMP, PWE3, and
L2PVN) that are chartered to do MPLS TP work.
