We propose a BOF/ proto-WG session for the Vancouver IETF to discuss
internationalization of email addresses, including a supporting SMTP
Extension and the required internationalization of email headers,
expressing the latter in UTF-8. A design team based in the Joint
Engineering Team, consisting of specialists from CNNIC, JPNIC/JPRS,
KRNIC, and TWNIC plus some invited specialists have prepared and
posted key base documents for this work.

Internationalization of email addresses is the key next step in
moving the Internet from its base in ASCII-only identifiers.
People's desire to use their names, correctly spelled, in email
address local-parts is far stronger than the desire to use
internationalized domain names, already standardized by the IETF.

The goal of this work is to pursue, via a WG and IETF processes,
one possible approach to email internationalization, carrying it
through to a series of Experimental specifications. Once those
specifications exist, implementations will be created and tested.
If the results of that work are satisfactory, a reconstituted WG
will be proposed to standardize the approach.

The longer session is proposed in order to start community review
on the documents and strategy themselves, rather than just
establishing interest (which is already clear from the JET effort
and an earlier effort/mailing list that operated under the "IMAA"
label) and reviewing the proposed charter.
