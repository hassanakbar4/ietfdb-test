This BOF will begin with a summary of the Distributed Indexing/Searching
Workshop sponsored by the Web Consortium, held May 28-29 (see
http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Search/960528/cfp.html).  We will then explore 
how
the recommendations of this workshop relate to IETF Directory groups, 
and
consider what, if anything, the IETF should do in this area.
