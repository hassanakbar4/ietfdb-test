The Site Security Policy Handbook Working Group is chartered to create
a handbook that will help sites develop their own site-specific
policies and procedures to deal with computer security problems and
their prevention.

Among the issues to be considered in this group are:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Establishing official site policy on computer security:

\begin{itemize}

\item       Define authorized access to computing resources.
\item       Define what to do when local users violate the access policy.
\item       Define what to do when local users violate the access policy of
         a remote site.
\item       Define what to do when outsiders violate the access policy.
\item       Define actions to take when unauthorized activity is suspected.
\end{itemize}

\item Establishing procedures to prevent security problems:

\begin{itemize}
\item        System security audits.
\item        Account management procedures.
\item        Password management procedures.
\item        Configuration management procedures.
\end{itemize}

\item Establishing procedures to use when unauthorized activity occurs:

\begin{itemize}
\item        Developing lists of responsibilities and authorities:  site
         management, system administrators, site security personnel,
         response teams.
\item        Establishing contacts with investigative agencies.
\item        Notification of site legal counsel.
\item        Pre-defined actions on specific types of incidents (e.g.,
         monitor activity, shut-down system).
\item        Developing notification lists (who is notified of what).
\end{itemize}

\item Establishing post-incident procedures

\begin{itemize}
\item        Removing vulnerabilities.
\item        Capturing lessons learned.
\item        Upgrading policies and procedures.
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
