The Calendaring and Scheduling standards, defined in RFC's 2445, 2446,
and 2447 were released in November 1998, and further described in RFC
3283. They were designed to progress the level of interoperability
between dissimilar calendaring and scheduling systems. The Calendaring
and Scheduling Core Object Specification, iCalendar, succeeded in
establishing itself as the common format for exchanging calendaring
information across the Internet. On the other hand, only basic
interoperability has been achieved between different scheduling 
systems.

The Calsify working group is chartered to:

(1) Revise the Calendaring and Scheduling Standards to advance the
state of interoperable calendaring and scheduling by addressing
the known interoperability issues, errata, and problems found based on
implementation experience.

(2) Clarify the registration process for iCalendar extensions (i.e.,
the current core object specification only provides a template
to register new properties).

(3) Provide a means to ease transition from, and to co-exist with,
the earlier iCalendar standards to the new ones.

Proposing an XML representation or transformation of iCalendar
objects is out of the scope of this working group.

Depending on the results of the update process on the standards 
documents the working group will consider whether advancing the 
documents to draft standard is appropriate. If we decide to move the 
documents to draft status, milestones may get changed and/or added
to allow for any additional work necessary to advance the documents.
