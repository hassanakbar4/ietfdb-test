There is widespread customer and industry interest in the deployment
and use of IP based virtual private networks (VPN).  An IP VPN can be
defined as the emulation of a private network facility across a shared 
IP based network infrastructure. The goal is to provide the same set of
services that are provided to the user in the private network over the
VPN. There may be many distinct types of VPNs,reflecting the wide 
variety of communication needs of customers. Customers can use their own 
equipment to provide the functionality needed for a VPN, an ISP can 
provide this service, or it may be a cooperative combination of 
functionality provided by customer equipment and ISP services. 

There was a general consensus on the mailing list that the problem is 
relevant and that there is a need for a forum for discussing them. We 
feel there is a need for a working group to work on defining the 
requirements, framework, architecture, service interface and 
requirements for mechanisms to implement VPN's. 

The goal of the BOF is:
   - Agree on the VPN models the group should define: CPE based, ISP 
based and a hybrid model.
   - Agree on the services these models provide: Routing & Addressing,
Security, Traffic Engineering and VPN Management (Membership discovery,
determination, and enrollment)
   - Agree on a working group charter and the documents the working 
group should produce initially- Requirements, Framework and 
Architecture.
