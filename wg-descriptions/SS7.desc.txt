The goals of the BOF will be as follows:

- Identify SS7 functions and related applications that potentially
  interact with IP networks, for example:
  - SS7 interface to control a Network Access
    Server
  - access to SS7 services/information

- Discuss an initial architectural framework for these functions

- Identify areas where new specifications or IETF activity is needed 
  for areas such as, for example:
  - protocol between SS7 gateway and NAS
  - transport of signaling over IP
  - other

- Depending on the level of interest, decide to form a working group 
  or continue discussions for the future.  If a working group is 
  formed, agree on scope and mandate.
