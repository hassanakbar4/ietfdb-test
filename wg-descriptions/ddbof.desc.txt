This meeting's purpose is to discuss what actions, if any, the IETF
should take regarding the standardization of mechanisms that discover
directly adjacent network nodes.


Several proprietary solutions exist in this area. As such, network
operators feel the need for an interoperable solution that covers the
needs of IP network infrastructure nodes as well as layer 2 devices.


Current efforts in this area by other standard bodies will be
discussed, as well as the potential for collaboration with those
efforts.
