We have now had a number of sessions in the OPS Operna Area Meeting
and in interim meetings at NANOG, RIPE, and by the time of the IETF
also at LISA. Communication between Operators and IETF-NM folk have
improved quite a bit. But what we need is a simple and minimal
requirements document (Informational RFC is what we are thinking of 
for now) that we can then use to steer further work in the IETF.
 
In order to try and come to closure on this, we will have this
BOF at the 52nd IETF to help focus on the above goal. We are
targeting closure on this either at the BOF or on the OPS-NM
mailing list no later than feb 2002.
