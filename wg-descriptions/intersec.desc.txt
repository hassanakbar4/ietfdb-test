This BOF begins with the observation that there are some circumstances
in which systems overall can benefit if the end-system knows about a
transport service intermediary and sets out information for it, such
as TCP or QoS classifier information.  In particular, more secure
services may be possible.

The BOF will discuss requirements for a possible protocol in this
space and explore how IETF might work with these.
