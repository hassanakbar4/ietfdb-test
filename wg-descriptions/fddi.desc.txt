The IP over FDDI Working Group is chartered to create Internet
Standards for the use of the Internet Protocol and related protocols
on the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) medium. This protocol
will provide support for the wide variety of FDDI configurations
(e.g., dual MAC stations) in such a way as to not constrain their
application, while maintaining the architectural philosophy of the
Internet protocol suite. The Group will maintain liaison with other
interested parties (e.g., ANSI ASC X3T9.5) to ensure technical
alignment with other standards.  This Group is specifically not
chartered to provide solutions to mixed media bridging problems.
