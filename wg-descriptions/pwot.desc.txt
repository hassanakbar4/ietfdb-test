The PWOT BOF at IETF50 is the successor to the Circuit Emulation over 
Transport (ceot) BOF of IETF49 and it is a formative discussion for a 
proposed working group that will be in the Transport Area and will 
probably be called Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (pwe3).

The basic idea is to provide services that appear as "pseudo wires" 
across a packet switched networks, from edge-to-edge, that is that can 
be treated as wires in an internetwork. Transport technologies, in the 
IETF sense of transport, are involved becacsue of the requirements of 
some technologies (e.g. TDM or ATM) for timing recovery or ordered 
delivery.

The purpose of the proposed WG is standardization within the IETF of 
pseudo-wire services. The working group will focus on development of a 
common edge-to-edge signaling protocol plane for the tunnel, and specify 
techniques for both encapsulating service-specific PDUs and achieving 
service-specific characteristics, such as ordered delivery, timing, and 
so on.
