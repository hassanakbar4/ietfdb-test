The Draft Charter (see following text) contains a detailed description 
of the proposed working group as well as references to the mailing 
list and its archive. The constituency met in an ad-hoc fashion under 
the auspices of the SIPPING working group at IETF 62, 63 64. Minutes 
of those discussions are posted at:

Historically, the level of interest in this work gas been very high, 
with more than 50 people attending the ad-hoc sessions despite their 
unusual scheduling. There are existing drafts for use cases, 
requirements, and two different solution approaches in the IETF 
depository at the time of this request. Some of these documents have
been revised several times and are beginning to mature.

The most significant challenge the constituency has faced is narrowing 
its focus to a scope that is manageable in an IETF working group. We 
believe the following draft charter addresses that focus and has 
strong consensus in the community.
