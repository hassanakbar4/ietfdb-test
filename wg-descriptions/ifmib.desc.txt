The Interfaces MIB working group is reactivated and chartered to 
accomplish one task: to prepare a recommendation to the IESG evaluating 
RFC 1573 with respect to the standards track.

The recommendation will document implementation, interoperability, and 
deployment experience.  If this experiences suggests that changes 
should 
be made to the documents, new drafts may be prepared.

The recommendation will report one of four outcomes: that the RFC 
should 
be advanced from proposed to draft status, without changes (if no 
problems are found); that a draft prepared by the working group, should 
replace the RFC, and be designated a draft standard (if only minor 
changes are made); that a draft prepared by the working group, should  
 
replace the RFC, and be designated a proposed standard (if major 
changes 
or feature enhancements are made); or, that the RFC should be 
designated 
as historic (if this technology is problematic).
