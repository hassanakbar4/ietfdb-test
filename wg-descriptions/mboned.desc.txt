The MBONE Deployment Working Group is a forum for coordinating
the deployment, engineering, and operation of multicast routing
protocols and procedures in the global Internet. This activity will
include, but not be limited to:

- Documenting deployment of multicast routing in the global Internet.

- Receive regular reports on the current state of the deployment of
  multicast technology. Create "practice and experience" documents that
  capture the experience of those who have deployed and are deploying
  various multicast technologies.

- Based on reports and other information, provide feedback to other
  relevant working groups.

- Develop mechanisms and procedures for sharing operational
  information to aid in operation of the multicast backbones and
  interconnects. 

- Update RFC 3171/BCP 51 based on experience. 

- Develop a roadmap informational RFC that describes the current
  IPv4 and IPv6 IETF multicast architectures, including
  references to the relevant IETF documents and guidance for
  implementers and network operators. 

- Complete the MSDP MIB

This is not meant to be a protocol development Working Group.
