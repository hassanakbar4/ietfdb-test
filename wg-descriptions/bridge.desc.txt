The Bridge MIB Working Group is chartered to define a set of managed 
objects that instrument devices that conform to the IEEE 802.1
standards for MAC-layer bridges.

This set of objects should be largely compliant with (and even draw 
from) those objects defined within each of the IEEE 802.1 standards, 
although there is no requirement that any specific object be present 
or 
absent.

The set of objects should not duplicate, nor conflict with any MIB
object definitions defined by the IEEE 802.1 standards themselves.

The MIB object definitions produced will be for use by SNMP and will 
be 
consistent with other SNMP objects, standards, and conventions.
