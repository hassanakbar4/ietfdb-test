The working group is defining the use of serial lines in data
networks.  While the main intent is to standardize the connection of
IP networks over point-to-point links, the protocol is being designed
to be extensible to other network protocols as well.  The protocol
will provide the capability of establishing the link parameters,
authentication, link encryption, link testing, as well as control of
the link while it is up.  The protocol will also allow configuration
and control of the higher level protocols such as IP, OSI, 802.3
bridging, and others.
