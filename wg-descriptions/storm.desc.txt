The purpose of the storm BOF is to determine whether a working group
should be formed for maintenance and update of these storage-related
protocols based primarily on implementation experience.  This work
is envisioned to encompass:

- Implementation-driven revisions and updates to existing protocols
	(i.e., updated RFCs that match the "running code").
- Interoperability reports as needed for the resulting revised
	protocols that are appropriate for Draft Standard RFC status.
- Minor protocol changes or additions; this is anticipated to
	include iSCSI features for SAM-4 compliance, some minor
	iSER corrections/clarifications and an MPA startup change
	needed to better support MPI applications.
