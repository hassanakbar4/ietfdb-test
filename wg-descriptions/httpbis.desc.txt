HTTP is one of the most successful and widely-used protocols on the
Internet today. However, its specification has several editorial
issues. Additionally, after years of implementation and extension,
several ambiguities have become evident, impairing interoperability
and the ability to easily implement and use HTTP.

The working group will refine RFC2616 to:
* Incorporate errata and updates (e.g., references, IANA registries, 
ABNF)
* Fix editorial problems which have led to misunderstandings of the 
specification
* Clarify conformance requirements
* Remove known ambiguities where they affect interoperability
* Clarify existing methods of extensibility
* Remove or deprecate those features that are not widely implemented 
and also unduly affect interoperability
* Where necessary, add implementation advice
* Document the security properties of HTTP and its associated 
echanisms (e.g., Basic and Digest authentication, cookies, TLS) for
common applications

In doing so, it should consider:
* Implementer experience
* Demonstrated use of HTTP
* Impact on existing implementations and deployments

The Working Group must not introduce a new version of HTTP and should 
not add new functionality to HTTP. The WG is not tasked with producing 
new methods, headers, or extension mechanisms, but may introduce new 
protocol elements if necessary as part of revising existing 
functionality which has proven to be problematic

The Working Group's specification deliverables are:
* A document that is suitable to supersede RFC 2616
* A document cataloguing the security properties of HTTP
