The purpose of the BOF is to discuss the need for a working
group to develop data representations and protocols that allow
entities in different organizations to express and negotiate
the conditions under which they will communicate for various
network services.  The conditions are expected to include
security-related mechanisms for authentication and integrity;
the representations and protocols for accomplishing the
negotiation are themselves security relevant and may be
the subject of analysis.  The output of such a working group
would be related to GSSAPI, IPSEC and IPSECOND, public key
working groups, and DNSSEC; the BOF will explore whether or
not the policy expression and negotiation are distinct enough
from activities in the other groups to warrant the formation
of a new WG.
