The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP, RFC 1661) is a mature protocol with a
large number of subprotocols, encapsulations and other extensions. The
PPPEXT working group exists to provide a forum for asking clarifications
about the existing specifications and to defend against enhancements
of questionable value. The group is not expected to create new
specifications, and if a need for such work comes up, a recharter is
required. The group may, however, advance existing specifications
to the next level in the standards track, if a need for that comes up.
Similarly, the group may classify existing specifications as Historic
where this is appropriate.
