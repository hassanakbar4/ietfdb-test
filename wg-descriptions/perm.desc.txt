The primary purpose of this proposed working group is to develop the 
PERM protocol.  The PERM protocol provides secure management of usage 
rights for digital entertainment content. PERM is not intended to 
replace existing television conditional access systems or device 
content protection mechanisms. Rather, it is intended to complement 
such systems by providing authenticated signaling of usage-rights for 
content works that have usage rights associated with them.  PERM 
signaling operates across heterogeneous data networks, particularly 
home networks, and uses Internet standards where appropriate.

The PERM Working Group will identify existing Internet standards-track
documents suitable for supporting PERM signaling and security needs.  
This investigation will be documented in a "PERM Framework" 
Informational-track document.  Following the framework document, one or 
more PERM specifications will be published as standards-track 
documents.  It is entirely possible that the current PERM specification 
will be edited by the working group and published with modest changes.  
It is the task of the PERM working group, however, to ensure that the 
PERM protocol is integrity-protected, optionally private, and safe to 
use on both unicast and multicast networks.  The PERM working group 
will ensure PERM compatibility with the authorization, credential, and 
public-key standards published by the IETF.
