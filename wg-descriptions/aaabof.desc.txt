This BOF is for the discussion of AAA protocol requirements and
potential solutions. One working group, the RSVP Authentication and
Policy (RAP) WG has been working on a protocol API that will enable AAA
services to be offered to RSVP routers and hosts by a central server;
other working groups are interested in AAA services as well. An
alternative proposal, DIAMETER, has been proposed and is being seriously
considered by some.

We want to meet to discuss the requirements of various working groups,
consider the alternatives, and recommend a technical direction. Possible
outcomes include a working group, or a recommendation that DIAMETER be
placed on the standards track as an individual submission, or that COPS
be extended to meet various needs, or that other approaches be
considered.
