Rapid advances in communication technology have accentuated the need
for security in the Internet. The IP Security Protocol Working Group
(IPSEC) will develop mechanisms to protect client protocols of IP. A
security protocol in the network layer will be developed to provide
cryptographic security services that will flexibly support combinations
of authentication, integrity, access control, and confidentiality.

The protocol formats for the IP Authentication Header (AH) and IP
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) will be independent of the
cryptographic algorithm. The preliminary goals will specifically pursue
host-to-host security followed by subnet-to-subnet and host-to-subnet
topologies.

Protocol and cryptographic techniques will also be developed to support
the key management requirements of the network layer security. The
Internet Key Management Protocol (IKMP) will be specified as an
application layer protocol that is independent of the lower layer
security protocol. The protocol will initially support public key-based
techniques. Flexibility in the protocol will allow eventual support of
Key Distribution Centers (KDC), such as are used by Kerberos.
