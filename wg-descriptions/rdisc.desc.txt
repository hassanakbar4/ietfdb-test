The Router Discovery Working Group is chartered to adopt or develop a
protocol that Internet hosts may use to dynamically discover the
addresses of operational neighboring gateways.  The group is expected
to propose its chosen protocol as a standard for gateway discovery in
the Internet.

The work of this group is distinguished from that of the Host
Configuration Working Group in that this group is concerned with the
dynamic tracking of router availability by hosts rather than the
initialization of various pieces of host state (which might include
router addresses) at host-startup time.
