     The DECnet Phase IV MIB Working Group is chartered to prepare 
     a recommendation to the IESG evaluating the standards track status  
     of RFC 1289 (the DECnet Phase IV MIB).

     The recommendation will document implementation, interoperability,
     and deployment experience.  If this experience suggests that changes
     should be made to the document, a new draft may be prepared.  The
     recommendation will report one of four outcomes:

        - That RFC 1289 should be advanced from Proposed to Draft status,
          without changes (if no problems are found).

        - That a draft prepared by the working group, should replace RFC
          1289, and be designated a Draft Standard (if only minor
          changes are made).

        - That a draft prepared by the working group, should replace RFC
          1289, and be designated a Proposed Standard (if major
          changes or feature enhancements are made).

        - That RFC 1289 should be designated as Historic (if this
          technology is problematic).
