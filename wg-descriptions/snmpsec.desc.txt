Enhancements to the SNMP network management framework are being
contemplated within the SNMP Version 2 Working Group of the IETF. The
SNMP Security Working Group is chartered to consider changes to RFCs
1351, 1352, 1353 that may be required either for consistency with this
SNMP evolution effort or to reflect implementation experience with the
current specifications.
