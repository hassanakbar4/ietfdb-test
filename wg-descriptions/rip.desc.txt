The RIP Working Group was formed from the RIP Version 2 Working
Group, which was originally chartered to create the RIP-2 standard. 
Since several other RIP-related efforts are also occuring within 
the IETF, it was decided to create a single working group to handle 
them all.

The RIP Working Group is chartered to guide the following proposals 
and develop the following projects through the IETF standards track:

  - ``RIP Version 2'' (RFC 1723)

  - ``RIP Version 2 MIB Extension'' (RFC 1724)

  - ``Extensions to RIP to Support Demand Circuits'' (RFC 1582)

  - ``RIP-II Cryptographic Authentication'' (Internet-Draft)

Additionally, the RIP Working Group will handle the RIPng protocol 
which, in its first incarnation, will contain the minimum modifications 
to RIP-2 necessary to handle IPng.
