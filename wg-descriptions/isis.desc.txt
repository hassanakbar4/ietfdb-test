IS-IS is an IGP specified and standarized by ISO and incorporating 
extensions to support IP. It has been deployed successfully in the 
Internet for several years years. The IS-IS Working Group is chartered 
to document current protocol implementation practices and 
improvements, 
as well as to propose further extensions to be used within the scope 
of 
IS-IS and IP routing. Short term, the WG is expected to deliver a set 
of 
documents describing common implementation practices and extensions 
necessary to scale the protocol. These specifications will encourage 
multiple, inter-operable vendor implementations.

This working group will interact with other standards bodies that have
responsibility for standardizing IS-IS.
