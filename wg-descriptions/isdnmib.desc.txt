The goal of the working group is to define the minimal set of managed
objects for SNMP-based management of ISDN interfaces. ISDN interfaces
are supported on a variety of equipment (for data and voice) including
terminal adapters, bridges, hosts, and routers. The set of objects will
be consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.

The working group will solicit any existing enterprise-specific MIB
modules to use as input to the standard MIB. The scope of the MIB is to
support remote configuration and administration; support all ISDN
interfaces and switch types; provide statistical information of ISDN
call activity; a table of ISDN call history; and SNMP traps specific to
ISDN call activity. RFC 1573 shall be used to define interface layering
issues.
