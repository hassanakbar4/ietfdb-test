The next generation of the Internet Protocol (IPv6) is intended to
support Internet traffic for many years into the future by providing
enhancements over the capabilities of the existing IPv4 service. This
working group will produce specifications for the core functionality of
that service.  The working group shall carry out the recommendations of
the IPng Area Directors as outlined at the July 1994 IETF and in ``The
Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol,'' Internet-Draft,
(draft-ipng-recommendation-00.txt), September 1994.

The working group shall use the following documents as the basis of its
work:

  - Simple Internet Protocol Plus (SIPP) Specification (128 bit version)

  - SIPP Addressing Architecture

  - An Architecture for IPv6 Unicast Address Allocation

  - Simple SIPP Transition (SST) Overview

  - SIPP Program Interfaces for BSD Systems

  - SIPP Security Architecture

  - SIPP Authentication Header

  - SDRP Routing Header for SIPP-16

  - IP Next Generation Overview

  - ICMP and IGMP extensions for SIPP

  - FTP Operation Over Big Address Records (FOOBAR)

  - DNS Extensions to support SIPP

Enhancements to be considered:

  - Large Packets: Consider extensions for support of datagrams which 
are
    larger than 64K.

  - Source Routing: The working group shall consider enhanced source
    routing capabilities for IPng.

  - Tunneling:  Complete specification of IPng in IPng tunneling. 

  - Address format and assignment plan: The working group shall review 
the
    details of address structure as specified in [SIPP-16] and shall
    repair any deficiencies with respect to current or near-term
    addressing requirements, assuming a fixed, 16-byte size.  The
    specification shall provide a mechanism for supporting multiple
    additional formats, for possible enhancement to incorporate other
    popular addressing schemes.

  - Routing Structure: In completing the addressing details, the working
    group shall ensure that routing according to current, CIDR-like
    schemes can be supported comfortably.

  - Autoconfiguration: Coordinate with the IPng Address 
Autoconfiguration
    Working Group.

  - Transition: The working group shall coordinate with the related
    transition and conversion efforts (ngtrans, tacit, nosi, etc.) to
    ensure that the base specification provides the facilities required
    for the transition from IPv4.

  - Security: A set of base documents for IPng security shall be
    completed.  This shall include algorithms for authentication and
    privacy carried as IPng extension headers and include an initial
    selection of required encryption and key management algorithms and a
    facility to support other optional algorithms.  The working group
    should also examine IPng firewall issues and if necessary develop
    specific firewall frameworks.

  - Minimum MTU: Consider a larger minimum MTU. 

  - Header Compression: Consider ways to abbreviate the IPng header in 
the
    contexts of native IPng, multiple IPng packets in a flow, and
    encapsulated IPng.

  - TCP/UDP: The IPng Working Group will specify the procedures for 
hosts
    to compute and verify TCP/UDP pseudo-headers.  Any other changes to
    TCP beyond making TCP work with IPng are out of scope of the working
    group and should be dealt with by a TCPng Working Group.

The IPng Working Group will coordinate with other groups, including
Mobile IP, IPng Address Autoconfiguration, OSPF, IS-IS, RIPv2, IDR,
Security, Applications, Network Management, IP over ATM, etc.
