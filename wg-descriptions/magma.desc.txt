Group management protocols are crucial to the operation of multicast
within the Internet, and there are some benefits in extending group
management protocols to also be able to support anycast. These
protocols allow hosts to inform routers of their membership status 
within groups.  This working group will be responsible for developing 
the functionalities required for group membership reporting and other 
related actions.  This group will also address the initial 
authentication and access control issues associated with anycast group 
membership; this is likely to be limited to shared secrets and message 
authentication codes (MACs) much like current routing protocol
security.  Other aspects of Anycast, including architecture and
routing, are outside the groups scope.

The draft names listed below are the starting point for the work in 
the 
WG.

MAGMA specifications will include:

- Core IGMPv3/MLDv2 specifications.  These specifications will describe
  the protocol used between hosts and routers to share group membership
  information.  IGMPv3 and MLDv2 build on IGMPv2 and MLDv1 by adding
  two types of source-specific filtering; "include" (in which the
  system tells the router exactly which sources it desires) and 
  "exclude" (in which the system tells the router that it does *not* 
  desire a list of sources).

  - IGMPv3: The IDMR working group has submitted this for Proposed 
     Standard.
     MAGMA takes ownership after publication as RFC.

  - MLDv2: draft-vida-mld-v2-00.txt

- Multicast Source Filtering API.  This specification describes the API
  used to interact with IGMPv3 and MLDv2 to indicate source filters.
  
  - draft-ietf-idmr-msf-api-01.txt

- Host determination of network group membership.  In a multicast
  environment, systems may be interested in learning whether or not
  there are any group members, in order to save the trouble of sending
  data that nobody is listening to.

   - Multicast Source Notification of Interest Protocol:
     draft-ietf-idmr-msnip-00

- Multicast forwarding in tree topologies using IGMP/MLD Proxying
  - Create a single document from:
    - draft-ietf-idmr-igmp-proxy-00

    - draft-he-mixed-igmp-proxy-00

- Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) consideration document.  This work
  will describe the use of IGMPv3/MLDv2 in an SSM environment.
  - draft-holbrook-idmr-igmpv3-ssm-01.txt

- Considerations for "IGMP snooping" switches (switches that watch IGMP
  exchanges in order to determine multicast forwarding behavior)

- Multicast Router Discovery:
  The MAGMA group has taken ownership of this draft over from IDMR.
  It will be revised and submitted as a Proposed Standard.

- Snooping Considerations: draft-ietf-magma-mrdisc-00.txt
  (previous revisions draft-ietf-idmr-snoop-XX.txt)

- Group management MIBs
  - update RFC 2933 for IGMPv3
  - update RFC 3019 for MLDv2

- Interaction between IGMP/MLD and routing protocols
  - draft-ietf-idmr-igmpv3-and-routing-00.txt

- Extensions to MLD supporting anycast group memberships including
  authentication and access control mechanisms
  - draft-haberman-ipngwg-host-anycast-00.txt

In addition, this working group will coordinate with other IETF working
groups where multicast and anycast group management protocols are 
utilized as well as coordinating with the Multicast Security WG.
