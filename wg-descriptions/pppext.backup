The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) was designed to encapsulate multiple
protocols.  IP was the only network layer protocol defined in the
original documents.  The working group is defining the use of other
network layer protocols and options for PPP. The group will define the
use of protocols including: bridging, ISO, DECNET (Phase IV and V),
XNS, and others.  In addition, it will define new PPP options for the
existing protocol definitions, such as stronger authentication and
encryption methods.
