The use of LDAP is becoming increasingly popular, and the demand for
mail transfer agents (MTAs) to be able to extract relevant information 
is increasing along with it.  Of particular interest is settling upon a 
common schema for local email routing.  LDAP will *not* be contacted for 
routing e-mail until the MTA first determines that it is listed as an MX 
or A record for the host named on the right hand side of the email 
address.  The goal is to define which schema to use in requesting local 
routing information (a.k.a. aliasing) from an LDAP directory service.

There are currently no such standards-track specifications under review
in the IETF.  There is draft-lachman-ldap-mail-routing-03.txt, which is 
on track to become an Informational RFC; parts of this may be a good 
start at a standards-track specification (the focus here is narrower 
than in that draft). But competing proposals exist (I know of at least 
one I-D in the works), so the time seems right for a BOF to discuss 
whether an existing proposal is ready to move forward or if a working 
group is merited.  I therefore propose that such a BOF be held at the 
Orlando IETF meeting.
