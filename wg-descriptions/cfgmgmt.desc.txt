Discuss the terminology used in various WGs w.r.t. Policy Based 
(Network) Management. Then try to come to a common set of terms that we 
can all agree upon and that we then want each WG to start using. This 
will make it easier to discuss and read the documents being produced by 
these WGs; to list some:

POLICY - Policy Framework WG
RAP - Resource Allocation Protocols WG
DIFFSERV - Differentiated Services WG
IPSP - IPsec Policy BOF
