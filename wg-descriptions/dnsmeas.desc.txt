A number of recent measurement studies have looked at different facets
of how the DNS is operating/performing today.  This session will
present an overview of these findings and their implications.
As time permits, discussion will also include suggestions regarding
possible follow-on measurement studies.  *Fixes* to the DNS as
suggested by the measurement findings will be noted only at a high
level; they are not intended to be pursued in detail at the meeting.
