The TELNET Working Group will examine RFC 854, ``Telnet Protocol
Specification,'' in light of the last six years of technical
advancements, and will determine if it is still accurate with how the
TELNET protocol is being used today.  This group will also look at all 
the TELNET options, and decide which are still germane to current-day 
implementations of the TELNET protocol.


(1) Re-issue RFC 854 to reflect current knowledge and usage of the
    TELNET protocol.
   
(2) Create RFCs for new TELNET options to clarify or fill in any
    voids in the current option set.  Specifically: environment
	 variable passing, authentication, encryption, and compression.

(3) Act as a clearing-house for all proposed RFCs that deal with the
    TELNET protocol.
