This BOF is to introduce a new "Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery
Algorithm" and discuss IETF venues that might be used to complete the 
work.

This new algorithm does not rely on ICMP or other messages from the 
network (so it is not subject to the problems described in RFC2923).  
Instead it finds the proper MTU by starting with relatively small 
packets and searching upwards by probing with test packets.

Key portions of the algorithm need to be implemented in the transport 
layer. In particular any lost probes should not be treated as 
congestion 
signals. For this reason, it can be argued that this work belongs in 
the 
TSV area.

Many of the unresolved design issues pertain to the efficient use of 
shared state between concurrent and successive connections to the same 
destination. The complexities of the this aspect of the algorithm are 
due to the huge technological breadth and subtleties of the delivery 
semantics associated with the network and lower layers.  For this 
reason, it can be argued that this work belongs in the INT area.
