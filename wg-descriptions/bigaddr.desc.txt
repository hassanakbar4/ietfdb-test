The purpose of this BOF is to discuss the pros and cons of 
``geographical'' versus ``provider'' based addressing schemes for IPv7. 
 Since all of the proposals are capable of assigning addresses under 
either scheme or (hybrid), this discussion is independent of the IPv7 
proposals.

The primary goal is to establish and agree upon the pros and cons of 
both schemes, and to document that understanding.  This document, plus 
descriptions of the schemes (which will be available prior to the BOF) 
will serve as the basis for a consensus process concerning IPv7 
addressing.  A secondary goal is to reach and document a Group 
consensus.
