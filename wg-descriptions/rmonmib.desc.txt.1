    The LAN Monitoring MIB Working Group is chartered to define an
experimental MIB for monitoring LANs.

    The Working Group must first decide what it covers and what
terminology to use.  The initial thought was to investigate the
characteristics of some of the currently available products (Novell's
LANtern, HP's LanProbe, and Network General's Watch Dog).  From this
investigation MIB variables will be defined.  In accomplishing our
goals several areas will be addressed.  These include: identification
of the objects to place in the MIB, identification of the tree
structure and corresponding Object ID's for the MIB elements,
generation of the ASN.1 for these new elements, and a test
implementation.
