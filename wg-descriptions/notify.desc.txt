There appears to be significant interest in Internet-scale event
notifications.  Event notifications are useful in many domains, 
including web authoring, instant messaging, buddy lists, workflow, 
and internet printing.  While efforts are well underway to develop 
a standard protocol for instant messaging and personal presence, 
requirements for notification services in other domains suggest the 
need for development of an interoperable protocol for the registration, 
initiation, and transport of Internet event notifications.

This BOF aims to develop a better understanding among the different
communities of interest, elicit scenarios of use for an event 
notification service, refine requirements for an event notification 
service, and enumerate the application domains that will benefit from 
an event notification service, and discussion of how standardization
will occur in this area.  The BOF will also contain a report from the 
recent Workshop on Internet Scale Event Notifications (WISEN), held 
in mid-July.
