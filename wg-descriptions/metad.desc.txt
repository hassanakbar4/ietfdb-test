The purpose of this BOF is to gauge the interest in and begin
discussions for formalizing the requirements of, and develop a protocol 
for a robust, secure, text-based directory service protocol. Experience
with Internet-based, distributed, scalable search services, such as
globally-accessible directories and searchable distributed document
repositories, has demonstrated the continuing need for such a protocol.
Existing protocols have one or several unresolvable limitations for such
applications: limited security, limited query language facilities, high
"barrier to entry" for client and server applications.

The output of the BOF will be a to determine if there is sufficient 
interest to warrant a Working Group. If so, then a proposed charter, 
milestones and task assignments will be produced.
