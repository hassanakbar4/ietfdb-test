The purpose of this working group is to define and develop a standard
virtual router redundancy protocol for IPv4 and IPv6.  A virtual
router redundancy protocol is a protocol which allows several 
routers on a multiaccess link to utilize the same virtual IP address. 
One router will be elected as a master with the other routers acting as
backups in case of the failure of the master router.  The primary
motivation to using a virtual router redundancy protocol is that host
systems may be configured (manually or via DHCP) with a single default
gateway, rather than running an active routing protocol.  The protocol
should also support the ability to load share traffic when both routers
are up.

 The goals of this working group are:
 
 1. Define and develop a standard virtual router redundancy protocol
    for IPv4 and IPv6.

 2. Develop VRRP MIB(s).

 3. Separate specifications will be developed for IPv4 and IPv6.

 4. Determine whether static (configuration based) load sharing is
    adequate or if some amount of dynamic load sharing is required.

 5. Working group will examine security issues to determine what
    security threats it is appropriate for the VRRP protocol to 
    handle and include the appropriate mechanisms in the VRRP protocol.

  6. The internet draft "Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol"
     (draft-hinden-vrrp-00.txt) will be use as the basis of virtual
     router redundancy protocol.  The working group will also consider 
     other Internet-Drafts related to this topic allowing for issues 
     regarding change control, security, running code, etc.

   7. Intellectual property issues regarding the technology to
      develop a virtual router redundancy protocol will be identified
      and addressed.
