The Site Security Handbook Working Group is chartered to create two 
  documents: (1) a revised handbook that will help system and network
  administrators develop their own site-specific policies and procedures 
  to deal with computer security problems and their prevention and (2) a
  new handbook for users.  The text of these documents will be developed 
  from the existing RFC 1244, plus needed revisions and additions.
