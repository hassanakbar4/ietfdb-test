Network based logging services provide system administrators with
an important tool for diagnosing a variety of problems.  There is
no standard way to do logging.   We propose a single very simple
protocol which will allow interoperable logging for the Internet.
This protocol will include features for structuring log entries
with fields which have standard definitions.  We would like to 
define a standard API, string based protocol and message format
for log entries.  We also will address internationalization of
logs, how to transmit log entries securely.  Another important
topic is how a logging protocol should interact with network 
management.
