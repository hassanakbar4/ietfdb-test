The Emergency Information Infrastructure (EII) Project is an effort
to foster the development and application of advanced telecommunications
networks in support of the emergency management community as a whole.

The ``emergency management community'' includes government agencies,
community-based organizations, businesses and corporations, media,
and the public.  At one time or another, virtually everyone takes 
some role in the emergency-management community.

This session will bring together leaders in network technology
with practitioners of emergency management to identify ways the
Internet can help communities adapt, adjust, and overcome both
large-scale disasters and day-to-day emergencies.
