With heavy use of RFC 1918 private addressing a number of applications 
have run into some difficulty.  This has been documented by the IAB in 
numerous RFCs and several drafts.  The purpose of this BOF is NOT to 
revisit those discussions, but to examine the current limits on NATs, 
and review some of the proposed mechanisms to deal with those 
limitations.  Based on that review we will decide whether a working 
group is necessary to (a) provide mechanisms and/or (b) review 
conflicting mechanisms.
