The OSI NSAP Guidelines Working Group will develop guidelines for NSAP
assignment and administration (AKA, the care and feeding of your NSAPs).

Assuming use of existing NSAP address standards, there are two
questions facing an administration:

\begin{itemize}

\item
 Do I want to be an administrative authority for allocating NSAPs?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
        how do I become an administrative authority?
		\begin{itemize}
		\item
          what organizations should expect to be an ``administrative
            authority'' in the GOSIP version 2.0 address structure?
		\item
          where do I go to become an administrative authority?
		\end{itemize}
	\item
        what are the administrative responsibilities involved?
		\begin{itemize}
		\item
           defining and implementing assignment procedures?
		\item
          maintaining the register of NSAP assignments.
		\item
        what are the advantages/disadvantages of being an
         administrative authority?
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\item
 Whether NSAPS are allocated from my own or some other
     administrative authority, what are the technical implications of
     allocating the substructure of NSAPs?

	\begin{itemize}
	\item
        what should be routing domains?
		\begin{itemize}
		\item
          implications of being a separate routing domain (how it will
            affect routes, optimality of routes, firewalls and
            information hiding).
		\item
          organizing routing domains by geography versus by
            organization versus by network topology....
		\end{itemize}
	\item
       within any routing domain, how should areas be configured?

		\begin{itemize}
		\item
         (same implications as above).
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
