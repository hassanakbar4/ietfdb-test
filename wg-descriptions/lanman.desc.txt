This working group is chartered to define and maintain the MIB and
relevant related mechanisms needed to allow management of workgroup
PCs and servers that are using the Microsoft Lan Manager protocols.
These protocols provide file and print service and mechanisms for
development of application server-client systems such as ones for mail
or SQL database.
