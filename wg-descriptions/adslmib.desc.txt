The working group will define a set of managed objects to be used for
management of newer versions of Digital Subscriber Line (xDSL) as 
defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.997.1 (02/2006).
The MIB defined by this group will be generated using SMIv2, will be
consistent with the SNMP management framework, and will describe the
relationship of the objects defined to existing MIBs such as those
described in other work products of this Working Group, the interfaces
MIB, and the AToM MIB.

The working group will consider the input of the DSL forum and the ITU
in the definition of this MIB.
