The number of information services (Gopher, WWW, etc.) on the 
Internet is
   growing rapidly.  This poses a problem for administrators, 
implementors
   and providers in maintaining the quality of the information service 
(as
   opposed to quality of the information itself).
 
   The aim of this working group is to deal with one of the specific
   problems with respect to quality of the information service, namely 
link
   problems.  A link problem is defined as the case where a user selects 
a
   link and is returned slow data, no data, incomplete data or wrong 
data.
 
   The working group will analyze link failures and their causes, and, 
based
   on the analysis, it will devise both technical solutions and 
operational
   recommendations to address this specific problem.
