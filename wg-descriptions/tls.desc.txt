The TLS Working Group was established in 1996 to standardize a
'transport layer' security protocol. The working group began with SSL
version 3.0. The TLS Working Group has completed a series of
specifications that describe the Transport Layer Security protocol
versions 1.0 and 1.1, extensions to the protocol, and new
ciphersuites to be used with TLS.

The primary goal of the WG is to publish a revision of TLS, version 
1.2, that removes the protocol's dependency on the MD5 and SHA-1 digest
algorithms, which have been either wholly or partially compromised by
recent research. The TLS WG will also work on new authenticated
encryption modes for TLS, including modes based on counter mode
encryption (CTR) and combined encryption/authentication modes, and
may define major new cipher suites for TLS for this purpose. In the
preparation of TLS 1.2, the WG will attempt to avoid gratuitous
changes to TLS 1.1.
