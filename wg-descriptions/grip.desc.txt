The full name of this working group is Guidelines and Recommendations 
for Security Incident Processing.

This working group is co-chartered by the Security Area.

The purpose of the GRIP Working Group is to provide guidelines and
recommendations to facilitate the consistent handling of security 
incidents in the Internet community. Guidelines will address technology 
vendors, network service providers and response teams in their roles 
assisting organizations in resolving security incidents. These 
relationships are functional and can exist within and across 
organizational boundaries.

The working group will produce a set of documents:

1) Guidelines for security incident response teams (IRT).

2) Guidelines for internet service providers (ISP) consisting of three
   documents covering the following topics:

   * Expectations on how ISPs will coordinate with each other and IRTs  
     in incident handling

   * Consumer Checklist on ISPs

   * Site Security Handbook (SSH) Addendum for ISPs

3) Guidelines for vendors (technology producers).
