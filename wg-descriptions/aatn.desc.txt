To address the limitations of the IPv4 address space the Internet
community needs to adopt variant technologies until IPv6 can be deployed
giving the Internet a new address space.  Three such technologies are
Network Address Translation (NAT), Link Tunnel Protocols like L2TP, and
the use of address translation in Firwall products.  This BOF would like
to investigate and discover if there is valid work to do, which can be
used to assist this IPv4 problem thru the Avoidance of Network Address
Translation on Networks (AATN).  This work would address todays need for
IPv4 and some of the needs for IPv6 which are not addressed by the
existing NGTRANS WG.  Because this work includes work specific just to
IPv4 it should not be part of NGTRANS, but there will be some overlap
clearly.  Engineers in our community have begun to work on AATN in
various manners and from several IETF WG mail lists this work appears to
have a growing interest.  This is also not part of the NAT work on going
as that function is to define and specifiy parts to do NAT.  One
objective of this work is to provide and insure that end-to-end host
connectivity is supported for mobility and IPSEC, without network 
address translation.
