The goal of the group is to specify the requirements for 
internationalized access to domain names and to specify a standards 
track protocol based on the requirements.

The scope of the group is to investigate the possible means of doing
this  and what methods are feasible given the technical impact they 
will
have on  the use of such names by humans as well as application 
programs, as well as the impact on  other users and administrators of 
the domain name system.

A fundamental requirement in this work is to not disturb the current 
use
and operation of the domain name system, and for the DNS to continue to
allow any system anywhere to resolve any domain name.

The group will not address the question of what, if any, body should
administer or control usage of names that use this functionality.

The group must identify consequences to the current deployed DNS
infrastructure, the protocols and the applications as well as 
transition
scenarios, where applicable.

The WG will actively ensure good communication with interested groups 
who are studying the problem of internationalized access to domain 
names.


The Action Item(s) for the Working Group are

1. An Informational RFC specifying the requirements for providing
   Internationalized access to domain names. The document should
   provide guidance for development solutions to this problem, taking
   localized (e.g. writing order) and related operational issues into
   consideration.

2. An Informational RFC or RFC's documenting the various proposals and
   Implementations of Internationalization (i18n) of Domain Names. The
   document(s) should also provide a technical evaluation of the
   proposals by the Working Group.

3. A standards track specification on access to internationalized 
domain
   names including specifying any transition issues.
