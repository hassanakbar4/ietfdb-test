The SDR Working Group is chartered to specify and promote the use of
SDRP (Source Demand Routing Protocol) as an inter-domain routing protocol
capability in conjunction with IDRP and BGP inter-domain routing
protocols.  The purpose of SDR is to support source-initiated selection
of inter-domain routes, to complement the intermediate node selection
provided by BGP/IDRP.

The goal of the SDR Working Group is to release the components of SDR
as IETF Prototypes and to obtain operational experience with SDR in the
Internet.  Once there is enough experience with SDR, the working group
will submit the SDR components to the IESG for standardization.

SDR has four components: packet formats for protocol control messages
and encapsulation of user datagrams, processing and forwarding of user
data and control messages, routing information distribution/collection
and route computation, and configuration and usage.


The group's strategy is to:

(1) Define the format, processing and forwarding of user datagram and
control messages so that SDR can be used very early on as an efficient
means of supporting ``configured'' inter-domain routes.  User packets are
encapsulated along with the source route and forwarded along the
``configured'' route.  Routes are static at the inter-domain level, but
are not static in terms of the intra-domain paths that packets will
take between specified points in the SDR route. The impact of
encapsulation on MTU, ICMP, performance, etc., are among the issues
that must be evaluated before deployment.

(2) Develop simple schemes for collecting dynamic domain-level
connectivity information, and route construction based on this
information, so that those domains that want to can make use of a
richer, and dynamic set of SDR routes.

(3) In parallel with (1) and (2), develop usage and configuration documents
and prototypes that demonstrate the utility of static-SDR and
simple-dynamic-SDR.

(4) After gaining some experience with the simple schemes for
distribution, develop a second generation of information distribution
and route construction schemes.  The group hopes to benefit from discussions
with IDPR and Nimrod developers at this future stage because the issues
faced are similar.

(5) The group will also investigate the addition of security options into the
SDRP forwarding and packet format specifications.
