Advances in radio and cellular communications technology are making it 
practical to exchange not just short text message but larger media-rich 
messages in a wireless environment. This BOF is intended to determine 
the need and interest in creating a new IETF working group within the 
Application Area. This working group would develop internet practices 
and standards to define how best multimedia messaging services could be
provided in a mobile or bandwidth-constrained Internet environment.  The 
emphasis is on the application level protocols, not the transport or 
network protocols associated with wireless networks.  Existing 
multimedia messaging related standards (e.g., MIME, POP3, IMAP, SMTP) 
would form the basis of this work, with additional work in areas to be 
determined at the BOF meeting, potentially including:
  * Push notifications to the client.
  * Deliver of messages according the quality of network connection 
    currently available (due to coverage, network capacity and user 
    subscription)
  * Setup and activate user profiles that define handling rules
  * Automatic or manual selective retrieval/forwarding of the parts 
    of individual messages
  * Control of message part transcoding before deliver to client.

If sufficient interest exists, this BOF will create a draft charter for
a working group defining the scope of work and relationships with other
IETF working groups and external standards organizations.
