The OSI-DS group works on issues relating to building an OSI Directory
Service using X.500 and its deployment on the Internet.  Whilst this
group is not directly concerned with piloting, the focus is practical,
and technical work needed as a pre-requisite to deployment of an open
Directory will be considered.
