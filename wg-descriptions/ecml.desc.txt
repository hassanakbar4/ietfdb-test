"The Electronic Commerce Modeling Language is a simple specification
of hierarical field names and field contents for communication between
parties engaged in electronic commerce. Version 1.0 (RFC 2706) is aimed 
at consumer to merchant information flow for such things as ship to 
address and card payment information. It is being widely deployed by 
merchants and wallet vendors. This BOF will discuss future developemnt 
of ECML within the IETF."
