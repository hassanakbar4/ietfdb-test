The Message Tracking Working Group will design a diagnostic protocol 
for 
a message originator to request information about the submission, 
transport, and delivery of a message regardless of its delivery status.

The group will produce two standards track documents: a message 
tracking 
model document and a protocol document. The model will state how 
message 
tracking is enabled, identify the entities involved, define how and 
when 
message tracking requests are issued and answered, define approaches 
for 
inter-domain message tracking, and address security issues. The 
submission, transport, and delivery of RFC 822bis messages will be 
tracked from the time such messages enter the messaging network up 
until 
the time they are discharged (e.g. to an IMAP server, to an end-user's 
mailbox, or a proprietary mail system).

The group will design one or more protocols to implement message 
tracking as described above.
