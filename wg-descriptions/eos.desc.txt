A small number of enhancements to the SNMP protocol would provide a
substantial improvement to the protocol in terms of utility and 
efficiency. The enhancements must fall within the existing SNMP 
architecture as defined in RFC 2571. The intent of the working group is 
to focus on enhancements that may be easily defined and implemented 
which should then promote rapid acceptance and deployment. New protocol 
operations are within the realm of acceptable enhancements that may be 
defined.

The initial work items include:

- A standards-track document defining the mechanism by which the
  capabilities of a SNMP entity may be determined. This document should
  also define the interoperability requirements of the SNMP protocol
  when extensions are present and when they are absent;

- A standards-track document defining a mechanism for efficient
  retrieval, creation, and deletion of rows in tables;

- A standards-track document defining a mechanism used to delete an 
  entire subtree of managed object instances. This could, for example, 
  be used to remove all information related to a particular username in 
  the SNMP administrative framework;

- A standards-track document defining a mechanism to provide for
  compression of object identifiers to remove as much redundant 
  information as possible in the payload of the SNMP message; and,

- A standards-track document defining a mechanism for bulk transfer of 
  SNMP data.

Some of the documents may be combined if the working group so decides.

No additional work items may be taken on by the working group until 
this
initial set of work is close to completion. Additional work will have 
to 
be approved by the IESG and the IAB.
