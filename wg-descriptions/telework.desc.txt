Draft 4/24/94 - mw

The recent series of natural disasters in California, together with an
ongoing goal of reducing worker commute time, has spurred interest in
telecommuting.  Telecommuting is a kind of remote interaction that
includes desktop videoteleconferencing, shared workspace and
computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and other mechanisms, in
support of part-week or full-time remote work, either from home or
hometown telecommuting center.  We propose a forum for discussing the
issues, limiting factors, enabling technologies, NII-evolution, and 
systems integration issues required to support telecommuting.
