The SNA NAU MIB Working Group is chartered to define a set of managed 
objects for SNA Network Accessible Units. These objects will provide the 
ability to monitor and control those devices, providing fault, 
configuration, and performance management, and will be consistent with 
the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.

The working group has completed MIBs for base SNA NAU functions, for LU 
Type 6.2 or APPC (Advanced Program-to-Program Communication), for APPN 
(Advanced Peer-to-Peer Networking), for APPN Dependent LU Requester 
(DLUR) and for APPN HPR (High Performance Routing). The working group is 
currently working on a MIB for APPN Extended Border Node (EBN) and one 
to define traps for APPN nodes to send. Work is also beginning on a MIB 
for APPN HPR in IP networks.

The working group will make sure that its work is aligned with the SNA 
DLC MIB Working Group, due to the close relationship between the devices 
being worked on by the two groups.
