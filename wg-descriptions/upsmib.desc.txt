This working group will produce a document that defines MIB objects
for use in monitoring and (possibly) controlling both high- and low-end 
UPSs and related systems (e.g., power distribution systems or power 
conditioning systems). Related devices may be addressed in this effort 
to the extent that the primary focus on UPSs is not compromised.

The MIB object definitions produced will be for use by SNMP and will be 
consistent with existing SNMP standards and framework.

At its discretion, the working group may fulfill its charter by the
development of distinct MIB definitions for UPS systems of differing
capabilities, but the number of MIB definitions produced by the
working group will not exceed two.

At its discretion, the working group may produce an additional document 
defining traps that support the management of UPSs.

Although the working group may choose to solicit input or expertise
from other relevant standards bodies, no extant standards efforts or
authorities are known with which alignment of this work is required.

Because the structure of UPS implementations varies widely, the
working group shall take special care that its definitions reflect a
generic and consistent architectural model of UPS management rather
than the structure of particular UPS implementations.

It was decided (May-Aug 98) to take the UPS MIB off the standards
track because of lack of initiative for the work required to allow the
document to advance to Draft Standard status. (Namely, gathering data
for and publishing an implementation/interoperability report. See RFC
2026 for details.) The MIB has been widely implemented by UPS vendors,
however, and the working group considers it useful for management. The
plan to re-issue the MIB as an Informational RFC reflects a compomise
which keeps the MIB available and "mordernizes" it to reflect changes
in the SNMP management framework.
