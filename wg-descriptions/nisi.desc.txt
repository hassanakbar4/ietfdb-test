The NISI Working Group will explore the requirements for common, shared
Internet-wide network information services. The goal is to develop an
understanding for what is required to implement an information services
``infrastructure'' for the Internet.  The work will begin with existing
NIC functions and services and should build upon work already being
done within the Internet community. A primary goal of the group is to
facilitate the development of relationships between NICs that will
result in the presentation of a seamless user support service.  NISI
will work with all NICs, including the InterNIC, to achieve the goal of
a fully-functioning, cooperative mesh of worldwide NICs.  In addition
to creating policies for interaction, NISI will address areas such as
common information formats, methods of access, user interface, and
issues relating to security and privacy of Internet databases.
