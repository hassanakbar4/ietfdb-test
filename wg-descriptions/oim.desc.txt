This Working Group will specify management information and protocols
necessary to manage IP-based and OSI-based LANs and WANs in the
Internet based on OSI Management standards and drafts, NIST
Implementors Agreements and NMF Recommendations. It will also provide
input to ANSI, ISO, NIST and NMF based on experience in the Internet,
and thereby influence the final form of OSI International Standards on
management.
