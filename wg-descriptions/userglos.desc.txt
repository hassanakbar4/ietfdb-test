The Internet User Glossary Working Group is chartered to create an
Internet glossary of networking terms and acronyms for the Internet
community.

The working group will update the existing Internet Users' Glossary 
(RFC-1392, FYI-18), which is now over two years old.  The group will 
make any necessary corrections and add new terminology which has evolved 
since the last edition was created.
