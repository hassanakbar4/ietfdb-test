Most networks require a user to register and provide authentication 
information including their credentials before being allowed access or 
authorized to use certain resources.  Dial-up networks and others have 
relied on PPP's capability to do user authentication in conjunction with 
AAA(RADIUS) as a means to the process of user registration.  Wireless 
cellular networks have relied on specific layer 2 identifiers and layer 
3 messaging (NOT IP) to accomplish user registration.  However as new 
types of networks such as wireless LANS are deployed in hotspot areas, 
and other new types of access networks are deployed which provide 
connectivity to the Internet, the legacy mechanisms may not be 
appropriate in such scenarios.  The BOF aims to determine if a 
registration protocol decoupled from the lower layers is needed. Such a 
protocol has many potential applications.
