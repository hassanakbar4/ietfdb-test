The purpose of this BOF is to get interested parties together to gauge
consensus on which of several directions to go in next with the DNS
_protocols_.  The direction could take one of three general paths:
    1: Do nothing, wait for deployment and experience with the
	DNSIND and DNSSEC protocols
    2: Start work on some specific incremental improvements
	(discussion will include which improvements, see below)
    3: Redesign the protocols with the features of all the
	add-ons integrated into the base protocol.
There will be several presentations (as many as can be fit in, but
with preference for at least one in each category).

The organization of the name space (i.e. what TLDs exist, etc.) is out
of scope.  The BOF is to discuss the protocol only.

Specific areas that might be addressed  either as incremental
improvements or included in a redesign (note, this list is largely
based on one developed from suggestions at the DNSIND WG at the 35th
IETF in LA in March 1996.
 - Timed updates
 - Indirect A records (to ease renumbering)
 - CNAME for whole zones (to ease renaming)
 - improved IN-ADDR.ARPA (e.g. bitwise delegation)
 - Better support for autonomous DNS
 - Internationalization
 - A DNS "Host Requirements" spec (or two, one for implementations and
	one for operations)
 - Something like what DRUMS is doing for mail
 - Extended queries (multiple questions, answer all or answer any)
 - Decide on compression-of-new-types problem
 - Make DNS more self-configurable
	-automatic determination of zones
	-Loadable RR types
 - Fix the packet size limitation.
 - Multi-party update of domains
 - Multiple primaries with shared DB.
 - Better representation for naming things other than hosts (i.e. 
people)
	-Primarily for storing keys (see next)
 - Improved key management in DNS
	-ability to store keys for any entity that might want one.
 - Additional RRs to support Multicast
