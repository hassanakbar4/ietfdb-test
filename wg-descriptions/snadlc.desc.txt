The SNA DLC Services MIB Working Group is chartered to define a set 
of
	  managed
     objects for the SDLC and LLC-2 data link controls for SNA
     networks.  These objects will be the minimum necessary to provide
     the ability to monitor and control those devices, providing fault,
     configuration, and performance management, and will be consistent
     with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.

     The working group will consider existing enterprise-specific MIB 
modules
     that define objects which support management of these devices.  The
     group may choose to consider any work done by the IEEE in the
     area of managed object definition for LLC-2.  It will also make 
sure
     that its work is aligned with the SNA NAU Services MIB Working 
Group,
     due to the close relationship between the devices being worked on 
by 
     the two groups.

     The working group recognizes that managed objects for other SNA 
data
     link controls and related components (e.g., QLLC, System/370 
Channel,
     Data Link Switching, and ESCON) may need to be identified in the
     future.  These objects are out of scope for the current charter;
     however, once the group completes its charter, a new charter
     identifying some or all of these components may be considered.
