This working group is chartered to review the MIBs produced by the
madman group while in the Network Management Area (RFCs 1565, 1566,
and 1567 which were produced in January, 1994).

The aim of this re-activation is to review and update these MIBs in
the light of operational experience. This will lead to editorial and
clarification changes, and updates driven by operational requirements
based on experience.

There have been a number of commerical and research implementations of
these MIBs. The MIBs have also been adopted by the Electronic Mail
Association, who have made input to the MADMAN work.
