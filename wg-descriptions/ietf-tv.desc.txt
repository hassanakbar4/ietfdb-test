With recent changes in the IETF and ways in which interested parties
participate, there is a new push to re-evaluate the mechanisms that are
provided for remote participation and working group meeeting archiving.

For the past several years, two sessions have been multicast at two bit
rates (low and high). These sessions have also been recorded and made
available relatively soon after the meeting. More recently, experiments
have been conducted in an attempt to add additional rooms with unicast
support but only audio.

At this point, we are at a cross-roads. Because of perceived changes in
remote participant needs and funding availability, the IETF needs to
decide what is needed in terms of service to users. Furthermore, an
analysis needs to be done on what this service will cost and whether 
there is budget to support it.

This BOF is a chance for the IETF community to discuss these issues in 
an open forum and help decide what our next steps should be in providing
these services for future IETF meetings.

To kick off the discussion, we will present a summary of the effort and
resources involved in prior audio and video support and describe a few
service options which might be provided in the future.

We particularly would like to hear from past and current users of the 
IETF multicast/unicast services.

Note that while jabber use has become much more prevalent recently and 
its use affects how distance participation works, using instant 
messaging in IETF meetings is not the focus of this BoF.
