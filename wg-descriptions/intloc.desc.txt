Abstract

This BOF will study the problems of internationalization in Internet 
protocols, with particular emphasis on the knowledge needed to 
effectively internationalize Internet protocols.

The BOF is NOT specifically concerned with the DNS or attempts at 
information location services; it is trying to focus on the Internet 
protocol suite as a whole.

The BOF will be focused around a set of internet-drafts:

- draft-alvestrand-i18n-howto
- draft-hoffman-i18n-terms
- "I18N case studies" (not yet published)
- "I18N sorting and matching" (not yet published)

The public mailing list for the BOF is intloc-discuss@ops.ietf.org.
