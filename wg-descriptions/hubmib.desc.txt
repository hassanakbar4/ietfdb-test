The Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB WG is Chartered to define
a set of managed objects that instrument devices, MAUs and
interfaces that conform to the IEEE 802.3 standard for Ethernet.
This set of objects should be largely compliant with, and even
draw from IEEE 802.3, although there is no requirement that any
specific object be present or absent.

Close coordination with hardware standards development in
IEEE 802.3 will be followed. The WG chair will support the
communication with IEEE 802.3. When objects are added that
require hardware support, IEEE 802.3 shall be informed,
so that they consider to add them to their draft/standard.

The MIB object definitions produced will be for use by SNMP and
will be adequately consistent with other SNMP objects, standards
and conventions.

The working group will work on the following MIB modules
for the IEEE 802.3ah (Ethernet First Mile) interfaces and
devices:

- Ethernet First Mile (EFM) MIB common attributes, OAM operations and 
  statistics

- Copper EFM MIB

- Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPON) MIB

The base for the definition of the managed objects in these
MIB modules will be the management-related clauses in IEEE
802.3ah specification. The working group will also take
into consideration management objects defined by other
Working Groups in the IETF (ADSL MIB for example), or other
standard bodies (G.983.2), will avoid work duplication,
and describe the relationship with these specifications.

The working group will also work on a revision of the MAU MIB
so that it refers a IANA maintained TC for MAU types. This
will allow to add new MAU types in the future as the Ethernet
evolution requires without re-opening the MAU MIB RFC each time.
