Description of Working Group:
 
     The Mail and Directory Management Working Group is chartered to define
     four MIB modules: one for generic application monitoring, one for
     message relays (either SMTP or X.400 based), one for OSI
     Directory service (X.500), and a fourth for message stores.  The
     MIB modules will provide basic monitoring capabilities, and will be
     consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.
 
 Goals and Milestones: 
 
     Done Post an Internet-Draft of the generic application monitoring MIB.    

     Done Post an Internet-Draft of the message relay monitoring MIB.          

     Done Post an Internet-Draft of the OSI X.500 Directory Service MIB.

          application MIBs to the IESG for consideration as Proposed Standards.
