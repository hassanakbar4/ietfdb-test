The User Services Working Group of the IETF provides a regular forum
for people interested in all levels of user services to identify and
initiate projects designed to improve the quality of information
available to users of the Internet.  USWG's goals are:

1. Meet on a regular basis to consider projects designed to improve
    services to users.

2. Create working groups or other focus groups to carry out projects
   deemed worthy of pursuing.

3. Provide a forum in which user services providers can discuss and
   identify common concerns.

4. Take on work to update existing FYI documents when that work does
   not coincide with the scope of an existing Working Group.

This is an active, on-going working group in the USV area of the
IETF.  It is the spawning ground for establishing other working groups
in this area.
