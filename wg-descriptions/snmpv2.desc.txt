  The SNMPv2 Working Group is chartered to prepare a recommendation
  to the IESG evaluating RFCs 1441-1452 (the SNMPv2 document set)
  with respect to the standards track.  The recommendation will
  document implementation, interoperability, and deployment
  experience.  If these experiences suggest that changes should be
  made to the documents, new Internet-Drafts may be prepared.  The
  recommendation will report one of four outcomes for each RFC:

  - that the RFC should be advanced from Proposed to Draft status,
    without changes (if no problems are found);

  - that an Internet-Draft prepared by the working group should
    replace the RFC, and be designated a Draft Standard (if only
    minor changes are made);

  - that an Internet-Draft prepared by the working group should
    replace the RFC, and be designated a Proposed Standard (if
    major changes or feature enhancements are made); or,

  - that the RFC should be designated as Historic (if this
    technology is problematic).
