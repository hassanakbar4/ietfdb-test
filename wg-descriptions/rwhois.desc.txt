The RWhois Operational Development Working Group will be a forum
for coordinating the deployment, engineering and operation of the
RWhois protocol to replace the current centralized whois model. The
minimum attribute set will be defined to ensure that all delegated
registries maintain the required information. Required user
authentication will be defined to allow remote registration with RWhois
servers. Operational procedures will be established to ensure that all
delegated servers conform to a set of minimum standards. If necessary
the RWhois protocol specification will be updated to reflect changes in
requirments identifed during the working group tenure.
