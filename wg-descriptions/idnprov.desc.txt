As the global DNS applications and Top-Level Domain (TLD) registries 
begin to adopt the IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in 
Applications) standards the registration of IDNs (Internationalized 
Domain Names) at shared registry systems becomes an important element 
of operational functionality for domain registries.

Furthering the discussion from the PROVREG group, describing 
the "desire to allow a registrar to access multiple registries via the 
same protocol, even if the registries differ in operational models," 
there is interest for the same to apply to the provisioning of IDNs.

Although the EPP RFCs have already provided extension guidelines, due 
to the foreseeable frequency of IDN provisioning and the potential 
complexity for registrars if different implementations are adopted by 
different registries, it makes sense to try to establish standardized 
extensions for IDN provisioning.

In general, there are two main approaches to incorporating IDN 
provisioning elements to EPP: 
1. Extensions to Domain Mapping; or 
2. New IDN Object Mapping.

The goal of this BOF is to see if there is enough interest from the 
community to create a workgroup that would be chartered to create 
documents on both:
1. Requirements of IDN provisioning
2. Standard Extensions for IDN-over-EPP
