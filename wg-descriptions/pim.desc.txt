The Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Working Group has completed 
the standardization of PIM with RFC 4601. The WG has determined there 
is additional work to be accomplished and is chartered to standardize
extensions to RFC 4601 - Protocol Independent Multicast Version 2 -
Sparse Mode. These PIM extensions will involve reliability, resiliency,
scalability, management, and security.

The PIM WG will consider implications of VPN service on PIM when it's a
component of that service or when PIM interfaces with that service at a
VPN edge. If L2VPN or L3VPN WGs determine that support for multicast in
L2VPNs and/or L3VPNs requires extensions to PIM, then such extensions
could be developed within the PIM WG.

Additional work on the PIM-BIDIR and BSR drafts may also be necessary 
by the WG as these drafts progress through Standards Track.

The working group will continue to specify the MIB modules required for
PIM and its enhancements.

The PIM WG will further enhance RFC4601 as an even more scalable,
efficient and robust multicast routing protocol, which is capable of
supporting thousands of groups, different types of multicast
applications, and all major underlying layer-2 subnetwork technologies.
We will accomplish these enhancements by submitting drafts, to the 
IESG, involving reliable pim, pim join attributes and pim 
authentication.

The working group will initiate a new re-chartering effort if it is
determined that a Version 3 of PIM is required.
