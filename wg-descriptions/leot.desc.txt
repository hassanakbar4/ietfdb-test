SPs are focused on providing services for customer transport of layer 1 
and layer 2 (bit-based and frame-based) payloads over a unified 
infrastructure.  These services, often referred to as transparent 
transport, includes the transport of Ethernet, ATM and Frame Relay as 
well as methods for transporting time division multiplexed (TDM) digital 
signals (SONET circuit emulation) over a packet-oriented network.

The purpose of the BOF is to assess the viability of pursuing 
standardization work within the IETF for these technologies.
