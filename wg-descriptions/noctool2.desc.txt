The NOC-Tools Working Group will update and revise their catalog to
assist network managers in the selection and acquisition of diagnostic
and analytic tools for TCP/IP Internets.

- Update and revise the reference document that lists what tools are 
available,
  what they do, and where they can be obtained.

- Identify additional tools available to assist network managers in 
debugging 
  and maintaining their networks that were inadvertently omitted in 
previous 
  NOCTools catalog.

- Identify additional new or improved tools that have become apparent 
since the
  last compilation of the reference document.

- Arrange for the central (or multi-point) archiving of these tools in 
order to
  increase their availability.

- Establish procedures to ensure the ongoing maintenance of the 
reference and 
  the archive, and identify an organization willing to do it.
