The Mail Extensions Working Group will review, refine as
   needed, and then make a recommendation on standardization of several 
   recent proposals for standards-track compatible extensions to SMTP
   (via the Service Extensions mechanism), MIME (via new Content
   Subtypes), and MIME-MHS (via MIME Content Subtypes and usage rules).
 
   It will also act as the review body for several documents that
   clarify and provide applicability statements about the use of
   Internet mail: that work will ultimately lead to an update for the
   mail-related section of RFC 1123.  Part of that effort involves
   RARE WG-MSG documents that address the Internet's installed
   electronic mail infrastructure.  Since such documents should not
   be processed in RARE alone, this working group will act as the
   IETF focus for reviewing them.
 
   Initial drafts of all of the documents that the working group is
   expected to review have already been, or will soon be, published.
   The working group will be starting with documents that have been
   prepared as individual (or spontaneous design team) contributions.
   It is not expected to initiate new work. On the other hand, it is
   expected to make explicit ``not ready for standardization'' or
   ``inappropriate for standardization'' recommendations if that is
   appropriate.   

   The working group will be initialized with the following Internet-
	Drafts or their successors, listed alphabetically.  A major 
purpose
	of its first meeting is to prune or add to this list.
