Resilient Packet Rings (RPR), developed within the IEEE 802.17 RPR WG,
provides substantial enhancements in both efficiency and flexibility
over current bi-directional ring topologies. Benefits of resilient
packet rings include spatial re-use (full utilization of both
counter-rotating rings) while maintaining protection switching during
media faults, as well as defined mechanisms for topology discovery,
congestion control, and protection switching.
Reference the IEEE 802.17 RPR WG at http://www.ieee802.org/17/ for
further information. IEEE 802.17-2004 is currently published and work is
in progress on bridging enhancements.

The IPORPR Working Group will produce two documents:

1) An IPORPR definition of how to transport IP/MPLS over 802.17 RPR in
"basic mode". This document will cover encapsulation formats
(e.g., IPv4/IPv6), how to perform address resolution (e.g., ARP/ND), IP
multicast transmission, priority mapping to the RPR
"serviceClass", etc.

2) An IPORPR framework that goes beyond "basic mode," describing some
of the features and characteristics of 802.17 RPR, and how they
might be exploited by, e.g., IP or MPLS. For example, an RPR ring
can be accessed in a number of ways: it can be viewed as a "dumb"
LAN supporting traditional broadcast like Ethernet ("basic mode"),
or its advanced features could be exploited.

The IPoRPR WG will coordinate its activities with other appropriate
standards bodies and encourage cross participation with those
bodies. Coordination will take place with the following bodies in
particular: IEEE 802.17 (http://www.ieee802.org/17/) - ITU-T SG15 Q9,
11, 12 (http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com15/sg15.html)
