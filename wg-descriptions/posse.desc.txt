This BOF is to assemble a blue-ribbon panel to 

(1) identify and examine current operational problems with
    current Packet-over-SONET/SDH payload mappings

(2) identify short-term fixes and work-arounds

(3) establish a collaborative basis for a longer-term permanent 
    solution which provides for new SONET/SDH mappings for general
    payloads carrying bit- and byte- framed HDLC with large packet
    sizes.  With this mapping in place, all IETF protocols based 
    on HDLC framing can simply use it and not have to bother with 
    the complexities of SONET/SDH transport.
