The POISED95 Working Group is a focused effort to resolve some
long-standing issues of the standards process and IETF procedure:

o The Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) section of RFC 1602 is widely
  seen as inoperative, because it demands guarantees and procedures
  when licensing technologies that few, if any, donors will accept.

o The procedures of the NOMCOM, or Nominating Committee, have been
  quite informal and different with every NOMCOM.  They need to be 
codified.

o Standards procedure documented in RFC 1602 needs to be restated to
  reflect reality and to remove obsolete provisions.

o The ISOC has proposed creating a link between the IETF and ISOC, and
  has even created a committee to study the issue. The IETF needs a
  corresponding effort.

o Other issues as appropriate.

As befits an international organization, POISED95 will meet in
Stockholm and Dallas to try and gauge a rough consensus on these issues
and develop guidelines and drafts for the appropriate documents.
