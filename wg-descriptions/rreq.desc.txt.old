The Router Requirements Working Group has the goal of rewriting
the existing Router Requirements RFC, RFC 1009, and a) bringing
it up to the organizational and requirement explicitness levels
of the Host Requirements RFCs, as well as b) including
references to more recent work, such as OSPF and BGP.

The working group will also instigate, review, or (if appropriate)
produce additional RFCs on related topics.  To date, group members have
produced draft documents discussing the operation of routers which are in
multiple routing domains (3 papers), TOS, and a routing table MIB.

The purposes of this project include:

- Defining what an IP router does in sufficient detail that
  routers from different vendors are truly interoperable.

- Providing guidance to vendors, implementors, and purchasers of
  IP routers.

The working group has decided that, unlike RFC 1009, the Router Requirements
document should not discuss link layer protocols or address resolution.
Instead, those topics should be covered in a separate Link Layer Requirements
document, applicable to hosts as well as routers.  Whether this group will
create the Link Layer Requirements document is still to be determined.
