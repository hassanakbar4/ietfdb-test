This is to announce the VTP (Virtual Tunneling Protocol) BOF at the 
37th IETF in San Jose. The BOF will take place Wednesday at 9:00. 
     
The VTP protocol may be used by a service provider to offer Virtual 
Private Network (VPN) services and dial access services to corporate 
home networks. This protocol can also be used to construct a corporate 
VPN by establishing VTP tunnels between routers at the branch and 
corporate offices.
     
In order to provide a true "multi-protocol" VPN technology, it is 
necessary to perform some form of encapsulation and tunneling in order 
to mask the private address space being used.  This technology must be 
sufficiently secure in order to protect the network resources from 
outside attack.
     
There exists some basic form of "multi-protocol" VPN technology today 
by some manufacturers, however these are either very static in nature 
or are proprietary solutions.  The intent of this document is to 
establish a standard, dynamic tunnel establishment scheme which 
require minimal configuration in order to ease deployment of such 
products.
     
VTP uses extensions to existing protocols such as GRE and Mobile-IP, 
which allow for easy implementations. In addition, VTP specifies an 
optional kerberos-like key management scheme for key distribution, 
which allows for multi-provider environments. However IPSEC is 
recommended as the underlying security mechanism.
