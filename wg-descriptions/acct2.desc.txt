  The Internet Acounting Working Group had the goal of producing 
  standards for the collection of accounting data within the Internet
  to support a wide range of management and cost allocation policies.
  This Internet Accouting 2 Working Group (acct2) continues by
  publishing the Accounting Architecture and Accounting Meter MIB RFCs
  as quickly as possible.

  The 'accounting model' is a generalized model for accounting data,
  covering the adjacent, peer and transport layers for several network
  protocols (IP, IPX, EtherTalk, DECnet and CLNS).  This will be
  developed further to include the application layer.

  File formats for accounting data storage are also of interest.  
  Standardization of these would facilitate data exchange between 
  accounting and billing systems (e.g., telco systems.)   The working
  group will also produce a requirements document for the further use
  of accounting data.

  The RMON Working Group is also interested in monitoring traffic flows 
  between pairs of hosts, an activity which is already covered by the
  accounting meter MIB.  This group will consult with RMON on this
  topic.  Other working groups (such as NASREQ and AAC) are also
  interested in accounting issues; this group will consult with them to
  ensure that such issues are addressed in a consistent way.
